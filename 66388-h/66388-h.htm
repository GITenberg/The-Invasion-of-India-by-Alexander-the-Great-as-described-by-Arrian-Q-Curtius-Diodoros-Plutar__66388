<p class="hanging">BERNIER’S TRAVELS IN THE MOGUL EMPIRE. An
entirely new edition, with illustrations, and reproductions of
maps from early editions. By <span class="smcap">Archibald Constable</span>, Mem.
As. Soc. Bengal, F.S.A.Scot. Cr. 8vo, pp. liv + 500. Price
6s. nett.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>The old translation has now been revised and edited in very scholarly
fashion.—<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>This is a scholarly volume, and bodes well for the success of the Miscellany.—<i>The
Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>The New Miscellany ... has been right worthily inaugurated by a reprint
of Bernier’s <i>Travels in India</i>, which must delight the scholar and lover of books.—<i>The
Bombay Gazette.</i></p>

<p>An almost perfect instance of careful, painstaking, and judicious editing.—<i>The
Pioneer.</i></p>

<p>The excellent editing, as well as outward get-up ... are a guarantee that
this new venture ... will supply a long-felt want.—<i>The Times of India.</i></p>

<p>The student will know how to prize the work, and the general reader will find
it very interesting reading.—<i>The Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p>Since their first appearance in Paris, in 1670, many have been the reprints and
translations of Bernier’s <i>Travels</i>.... With all this, however, the book itself
is not easily accessible. In offering the English Public a new edition of it,
Messrs. Archibald Constable and Company have therefore no need to apologise.
It is a fact that until this publication no really satisfactory edition has existed. It
is now edited not only with great care, but also with a laudable regard to the
needs of the general reader.—<i>The Anti-Jacobin.</i></p>

<p>The book abounds with curious scenes and anecdotes of native life in India,
amusing in themselves and interesting for comparison with the ways, habits, and
ideas of modern India.... The running glossary of Indian terms and words is
very useful; so are the brief notices of distinguished persons and remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Ads_Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
places mentioned in the text; there is also a chronicle of Bernier’s life, a bibliography
of his works, and an excellent index.—<i>The Speaker.</i></p>

<p>The book is of almost indispensable necessity to the reader of history, being
accurate and painstaking to a high degree.—<i>The Academy.</i></p>

<p>The volume has been admirably edited and illustrated. The numerous
allusions in the text to individuals, places, productions of art and industry, etc.,
are well explained in brief but sufficient notes, which contain the results of careful
research in contemporary historians, and of an intimate personal acquaintance
with Indian life and industry at the present day.—<i>The Scottish Geographical
Magazine.</i></p>

<p class="titlepage">Vol. II.</p>

<p class="hanging">POPULAR READINGS IN SCIENCE. By <span class="smcap">John Gall</span>,
M.A., LL.B., late Professor of Mathematics and Physics,
Canning College, Lucknow, and <span class="smcap">David Robertson</span>, M.A.,
LL.B., B.Sc. With many Diagrams, a Glossary of Technical
Terms, and an Index. Cr. 8vo, pp. 468. Price 5s. nett.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>The authors lay no claim to originality, but have exercised a judicious choice
in the selection of subject-matter.... The narrative style which has been
adopted by the authors will make the book acceptable to general readers who are
anxious to make acquaintance with modern science.—<i>Nature.</i></p>

<p>It is hardly to be expected that this second volume of Constable’s <i>Oriental
Miscellany</i> will meet with such universal acclamation as the first volume, which
consisted of Bernier’s <i>Travels</i>. But when rightly considered, it equally shows
the thoroughness with which the publishers have thrown themselves into the
enterprise.—<i>The Academy.</i></p>

<p>While the essays are such as would attract and instruct a general reader, they
appear to have been written specially with a view to the needs of Indian students
approaching the study of science for the first time.... They are well adapted
to this end, and cannot fail to create in their readers a desire to push their knowledge
further.—<i>The Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>The new volume of Constable’s <i>Oriental Miscellany</i> would have delighted
Macaulay and the champions of “Occidentalism” in Indian education in Lord
William Bentinck’s day.... Messrs. Gall and Robertson ... have prepared
a collection of essays which will be at least as acceptable to the general reader as
to the student, in which the results of the most modern researches in physical
science are brought up to date.... In each case the subject is treated in a clear
and interesting way ... it is a most commendable undertaking.—<i>The Bombay
Gazette.</i></p>

<p>The title sufficiently indicates the lines on which the two collaborators have
worked. Theirs is no dry-as-dust text-book; it is rather a collection of scientific
facts forming chapters in what has aptly been called the romance of science....
Messrs. Archibald Constable and Company have a particular interest in
this country, and their <i>Oriental Miscellany</i> is so well edited, printed, and published,
that it is easy to predict for it a wide popularity.—<i>The Madras Mail.</i></p>

<p>The second volume of Constable’s <i>Oriental Miscellany</i>, just published under
the above heading, has been designed to meet an undoubted want, and will
hardly yield in usefulness to any in the projected series.... While elementary
principles are explained with sufficient clearness to enable the work to be used
independently of other text-books, the compilers have devoted much attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Ads_Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
and space to many of the results of scientific researches which have mainly distinguished
the present century. The Darwinian theory, for instance, is not only
admirably summarised in itself, but we are furnished with a useful <i>précis</i> of the arguments
<i>pro et con</i>, together with an account of the more recent discoveries of paleontologists
which have strengthened the doctrine of the evolution of organic beings,
and an outline of the views regarding it of the <i>savants</i> of all nations. The book
is one which should secure a large number of general readers, who will find in
it a vast store of useful information placed before them in a peculiarly readable
and acceptable form.—<i>The Pioneer.</i></p>

<p>This is a popular treatise covering a very wide range of subjects.... A well-written
book like a modernised Lardner, or a <i>fin-de-siècle</i> edition of the <i>Scientific
Information for the People</i> of the “Useful Knowledge Series.”—<i>The Educational
Times.</i></p>

<p>The authors write about what they know, and they write with clearness and
precision, and on the topics which they discuss they have spoken with that
accuracy which comes from full knowledge.... The value of the book is
enhanced by a glossary of technical terms, which will be of the utmost possible
use to the beginner, and also of use to those who are somewhat advanced in
their studies.—<i>The Aberdeen Daily Free Press.</i></p>

of Dryden, and a coloured reproduction of an Indian painting
representing the Emperor Akbar deer-stalking. Cr. 8vo,
pp. xiii + 222. Price 5s. nett.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>An interesting reprint of Dryden’s tragedy.... If any one wishes to realise
by an hour’s easy reading the vast gulf which separates our knowledge of India
and our conceptions about India, at the close of this 19th century, from the views
of our ancestors about India in the last quarter of the 17th century, we recommend
this book to his notice. Mr. Deighton’s copious and suggestive footnotes
will render the perusal both profitable and pleasant.—<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>The volume, like its predecessors, is admirably got up, and is enriched by a
fine portrait of Dryden, and a capital reproduction of a highly curious and interesting
Indian picture exhibiting the youthful Akbar at the chase.—<i>The Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Kenneth Deighton supplies a short biography of Dryden, and a just
estimate of his dramatic power, taking due notice of the improvement in the later
tone of a poet who was largely made by his surroundings, and had to write to
please.... Ample notes, suited to the capacity of the Indian student, are incorporated
in the volume.—<i>The Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p class="hanging">STUDIES IN MOHAMMEDANISM, Historical and Doctrinal,
with a chapter on Islam in England. By <span class="smcap">John J. Pool</span>.
With a Frontispiece and Index, pp. xvi + 420. Cr. 8vo, full
cloth. Price 6s.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>An interesting survey—all the more readable, perhaps, on account of its informal
and even discursive arrangement—of Mussulman faith, practice, and
history.... A conspicuous feature of Mr. Pool’s work is the account of the
Moslem propaganda, which Mr. Quilliam, a Liverpool solicitor, is now prosecuting
in that city.... It is tinged by no rancour or contempt, and exhibits a
conscientious endeavour to appreciate the Mohammedan standpoint. As a
“popular text-book,” dealing with some of the most picturesque aspects of Islam,
it deserves more than ordinary attention.—<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Pool ... has done good service in publishing this popular exposition of
the doctrines and real character of Islam. So far as he errs at all, he errs on the
side of too much leniency to Mohammedanism.... Mr. Pool’s too favourable
account of the Moorish <i>régime</i> in Spain is the only part of his book that is open
to serious question. The rest of the volume is both readable and instructive.
He has evidently studied Islam with great care, and he states his own views with
exemplary moderation.—<i>The Spectator.</i></p>

<p>The chapter which gives information on this matter [Islam in Liverpool] is
naturally the most interesting in the volume.... As to the other parts of Mr.
Pool’s book it is difficult to speak too highly. His account of Mohammed and
his system is fair and full, abounding in all kinds of illustrative anecdote.—<i>The
Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>In the forty-one chapters of this volume the promise of the title is well kept,
and every aspect of Islam faith and practice is discussed in a clear, comprehensive,
and interesting manner.—<i>The Liverpool Mercury.</i></p>

<p>These <i>Studies in Mohammedanism</i> are conspicuously fair. The writer is
devotedly attached to Christianity, but he frankly and gladly acknowledges that
Mohammed was a man of extraordinary powers and gifts, and that the religion
which bears his name has done incalculable service to humanity in keeping the
sublime truth of the unity of God before the eyes of the non-Christian world
steeped in polytheism.—<i>The Bradford Observer.</i></p>

<p>This volume will be found both interesting and useful to the general reader, as
supplying in a convenient form a very good outline of the rise and development,
with an account of the more salient features, of the Mohammedan religion. There
are short chapters also on the Turks, Afghans, Corsairs, crusades, literature, architecture,
slavery, etc., which convey much public information in a pleasant style.—<i>The
Scottish Geographical Magazine.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE_TO_SECOND_EDITION">PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>

</div>

<p>Since this volume was written, three works have
appeared which not only make important additions to
our knowledge of Alexander’s campaigns in Turkestan,
Lower Sindh, and Makran respectively, but which also
serve to correct some current errors with regard to the
identification of places which lay in the route of the great
conqueror, as he passed through these obscure regions.
As the works referred to have been written by scholarly
men, who possess an intimate personal knowledge of the
localities which they describe, the conclusions to which
their investigations have conducted them may be accepted
with confidence, and we propose to give here a brief
summary of these conclusions so far as they concern our
subject. The works are these: 1. <i>Alexander des Grossen
Feldzüge in Turkestan</i>, von Franz Schwarz, München;
2. <i>The Indus Delta: a Memoir chiefly on its Ancient
History and Geography</i>, by Major-General M. R. Haig,
M.R.A.S., London; 3. <i>A Lecture on “The Retreat of
Alexander the Great from India,”</i> by Colonel Holdich,
R.E., as reported in the Calcutta <i>Englishman</i>.</p>

<p>We begin with Turkestan, by which is here meant
the provinces called anciently Baktriana and Sogdiana.
Their reduction, as will be seen from our Introduction (<a href="#Page_39">pp.
39-44</a>), occupied the arms of Alexander for upwards of
two years, from <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 329-327. The description of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
campaigns by which this conquest was effected has
hitherto proved a task of unusual difficulty, due partly to
imperfect knowledge of the geography of the seat of war,
and partly also to discrepancies in the accounts of these
campaigns as given by Arrian and Curtius, who neither
drew their facts from the same original sources nor relate
them in quite the same order of sequence. It is fortunate
therefore that Herr Schwarz, who for fifteen years resided
in Turkestan, and had occasion or opportunity during
that time to visit all its places of importance, sedulously
applied himself to study the antiquities of the country,
and was thus able ultimately to identify with certainty,
almost all the places in which Alexander is reported, by
his historians, to have shown himself. His work is accompanied
by an excellent map, in which he has traced the
line of the marches and the counter-marches of the
Macedonian troops, while operating in the regions of the
Oxus and the Jaxartes.</p>

<p>Alexander, in the early spring of 329 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, left Kabulistan,
and having crossed the Indian Kaukasos, arrived at
Drapsaka, and from thence continued his march to Aornos
and Baktra. It has never been doubted that Baktra is
now Balkh, but opinions have differed with regard to the
other two places. Schwarz, on sufficient grounds, identifies
Drapsaka with Kunduz, and Aornos with Tash-Kurgan,
near which are situated the ruins of Khulm.
Alexander, marching from Baktra through a frightful
desert, gained the banks of the Oxus, which he crossed
with his army in five days. The passage was effected,
not from Kizil, as has been hitherto supposed, but from
Kilif, higher up the stream—a place which Schwarz thinks
was probably the city of the Branchidai, which, with its
inhabitants, Alexander so remorselessly destroyed. From
the Oxus the expedition advanced by way of Karshi and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
Jam to Marakanda, the famous city of Samarcand.
Near Karshi, at the hill Kungur-tau, occurred the skirmish
in which Alexander, on this march, received a wound.
Marakanda was situated on the banks of the Polytimêtos,
now the Zerafshan or Kohik, which flows westward till its
waters are lost in the sands of the Khorasmian Desert.
Alexander marched thence to the river Tanais—the
Jaxartes or Syr-darya—which formed the eastern boundary
of the Persian empire, and separated it from the
Skythians. On the Persian side of this river Alexander
founded a city, which he called by his own name, Alexandria.
It is agreed on all hands that the site of this
Alexandria was at or near where Khojent now stands.
In this neighbourhood Alexander captured seven towns,
which had shown signs of a purpose to revolt. The
names of two of these have been recorded, Gaza and
Kyropolis. The former Schwarz identifies with Nau,
and the latter with Ura-tübe, a considerable city occupying
a commanding position, strongly fortified, and distant
from Khojent about 40 miles. It had been founded by
Cyrus to serve as a bulwark against incursions of the
Skythians. Alexander having quelled the attempted
revolt of the Sogdians, crossed the Jaxartes, and inflicted
a defeat on the Skythians, who had mustered in great
force on their own side of the river. He pursued them as
far as what Curtius calls the boundary-stones of Father
Bacchus, which Schwarz has identified as a pass over
Mogul-Tau, near Mursa-rabat, a post-station, 17 miles
distant from Khojent.</p>

<p>On the heels of this victory tidings reached Alexander
of the terrible defeat and slaughter of his Macedonian
troops by Spitamenes in one of the islands of the Polytimêtos,
and he immediately started for Marakanda, and
reached it after a march of three days. As the distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
from Khojent to Samarcand is 172 English miles, this
march, made in broiling heat, and through a country
without roads, must have tried to the very utmost the
powers of endurance of the Macedonian soldiers, some of
whom were hoplites, wearing their brazen helmets, carrying
their shields, and clad in mail. Spitamenes made his
escape into the desert, and Alexander could only sate
his vengeance by ravaging with merciless severity the
beautiful valley through which the river flowed. Schwarz
tells us that he searched in vain to discover the island
which was the scene of the disaster, and it probably no
longer exists. It must, however, he thinks, have been
situated in the neighbourhood of Ziadin and Kermineh.
Alexander, pursuing his way down the river, passed
Bokhara, the Sogdian capital, and advanced as far as
Karakul, beyond which the river disappears in the sands.
He then retired for the winter to Zariaspa. Zariaspa
has been taken to be another name of Baktra, but Schwarz
shows that such an opinion is altogether untenable, and
identifies it, for reasons not to be gainsaid, with Charjui, a
place some six or seven miles distant from where the Oxus
is now spanned by the bridge of the Trans-Caspian Railway.</p>

<p>From Zariaspa Alexander returned to Marakanda,
passing on his route by Karakul, Bokhara, Kermineh, and
Kata-Kurgan. Koinos meanwhile had difficulty in holding
his own against the indomitable Spitamenes, who had
collected at Bagai a body of 3000 Skythian horsemen,
with a view to invade Sogdiana. Bagai is now Ustuk, a
Bokharan frontier fortress, 28 miles below Charjui, but
on the opposite side of the Oxus. The hostile forces at
length came to an engagement. Koinos was victorious,
and Spitamenes, who fled into the desert with his Skythian
horsemen, fell a victim to their treachery. They cut off
his head, and sent it as a peace-offering to Alexander.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
After the reduction of Sogdiana, Alexander withdrew to
Nautaka, where he spent the winter of 328-327 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> This
place has been generally identified with Karshi, but
Schwarz takes it to be Schaar, which lies 40 miles to the
south of Samarcand.</p>

<p>Alexander left Nautaka early in spring, and his next
great exploit was the capture of the famous Sogdian
Rock, in the fortress of which Oxyartes had placed for
safety the members of his family, including his daughter,
the beautiful Roxana, whose charms so fascinated her
captor, that he made her his queen, in spite of all the
remonstrances of his friends. Curtius calls this stronghold
the Rock of Arimazes. Some have identified it with the
steep crags which line one side of the narrow gorge near
Derbent, called the Iron Gate, which forms the only direct
approach from West-Bokhara to Hissar. Schwarz, however,
says that the Iron Gate, through which he has
himself often passed, answers neither to the description of
Arrian nor of Curtius, and his own identification of the
Rock is with a mountain which ascends precipitously from
a gorge similar to that of the Iron Gate, from which it is
some five miles distant in a north-east direction. From
the Rock the expedition marched eastward into the country
of the Paraitakai, the mountainous district now known
as Hissar. Here Alexander’s progress was arrested by
another mountain fortress no less formidable than the
Sogdian. It is called by Arrian the Rock of Chorienes,
and by Curtius the Rock of Sysimithres. Its identification
presents no difficulty, as in all Hissar there is but one
place which answers the descriptions of it, namely, the
narrow pass at the river Waksh, where the Suspension
Bridge (Pul-i-Sangin) overspans it on the way from
Hissar through Faizabad to Badshuan. This pass,
Schwarz tells us, is the most remarkable place to which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
came in the whole course of his travels. The fort having
been surrendered through the persuasions of Oxyartes, the
conqueror returned to Baktra, by way of Faizabad, Hissar,
Karatag, and Yurchi, from which place he proceeded
down the right bank of the Surkhan to Tormiz, and
thence to the passage of the Oxus at Pata-gisar. On his
return to Baktra, he there made his preparations for the
invasion of India. We have here only further to notice
that Alexander’s visit to Margiana, the city now so well
known as Merv, could not have been made, as Curtius
informs us, from Bokhara, which is 215 miles distant
and separated from it by a terrible intervening desert, all
but entirely destitute of wells, but was probably made
from Sarakhs in the earlier part of the march from the
Caspian Gates.</p>

<p>We turn now to Major-General Haig’s <i>Memoir</i> on the
Indus-Delta country—a work of which about a fourth
part directly concerns our subject. The sections which
are of this nature discuss the following points:—1. The
Geography and Hydrography of the Delta Country (chap.
i.); 2. The Delta at the time of Alexander’s Expedition
(chap. ii.); 3. The Delta according to later Greek Accounts
(chap. iii.); 4. The Lonibare Mouth of the Indus
(Append. Note A); 5. The general course of the Indus
in Sindh in ancient times (Append. Note C); 6. Itineraries
in the Las Bêlâ Country (Append. Note D); 7.
The March to the Arabios (Append. Note E); 8. The
voyage of Nearchos from Alexander’s Haven to the
Mouth of the Arabios (Append. Note F).</p>

<p>Our author could scarcely have chosen for his subject
one that is more beset with problems of aggravating perplexity.
The Indus is notable even among Indian rivers
for the frequency, and sometimes also for the suddenness,
with which it changes its courses. As Colonel Holdich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
well observes, “The difficulty of restoring to the map of
India an outline of the ancient geography of Sindh and
the Indus Delta is one which has baffled many generations
of scholars. The vagaries of the Indus, even within
the limits of historic record, ... render this river, even
before the Delta is reached, a hopeless feature for reference
with regard to the position of places said once to
have been near its bank. Within the limits of the Delta
the confusion of hydrography becomes even more confounded.”
In my note on Alexander in Sindh, which will
be found at <a href="#Page_352">page 352</a>, I have noticed that the channel
in which the Indus now flows lies much farther to the
west than the channel in which the Macedonians found it
flowing. This <i>westing</i>, as it is called, is due to the
operation of the law, first discovered by K. E. von Baer,
that the difference of the velocity of the earth’s rotation
at the Equator and at the Poles causes eroding rivers in
the Northern Hemisphere to attack their right bank more
than the left, and to push their beds sideways—while in
the Southern Hemisphere, this action is reversed. From
the <i>Memoir</i> we learn how this law, and the other natural
laws by which its action is modified, have affected the
Indus. The river, we learn, pursues from the confluence
of the Panjnad a very uniform S.W. direction for nearly
300 miles, till it reaches lat. 26° 56´, long. 67° 53´. At
this point the river changes its general direction to one
due south, and maintains this for about 60 miles, till
it strikes, in lat. 26° 20´, long. 67° 55´, the eastern base of
the Lakî Hills, just under the peak called Bhago Toro.
Below this point the westing movement of centuries has
now brought the stream to the extreme edge of the
alluvial land, and into contact with the gravel slopes
bordering the hill-country. As the gravel tracts project
in a bow into the alluvial land of Lower Sindh, the river,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
unable to erode them, is forced to conform to their contour,
and to run in a great curve for nearly 180 miles to
Thata. This curve continues through the Delta to the
sea, so that from Bhago Toro to the river-mouth the course
of the Indus forms an arc of some 260 miles, of which the
chord is about 160 miles, and the maximum depth nearly
50 miles. The general result is to give the course of the
river in Sindh the form of the letter S. And, as its
abandoned channels attest, <i>such has been the form in
which the river has run in past ages</i> as it approached the
sea. The lower curve of the S had a still bolder sweep
<i>eastward</i> when the river ran far east of its present course,
unchecked by rock or gravel bed, than it has now, when
this part of the course has been shaped by a resistance
which the current cannot overcome. This S-shaped
course of the river <i>in all ages</i> should be remembered in
considering questions of ancient local topography, such,
for instance, as that of the site of Patala. It will then
be seen to be impossible that the river can have run at
the same period in its present course near Haidarâbâd,
and, lower down through the Ghâro, or ancient Sindh
Sâgara; also that if Patala was at Haidarâbâd, the
western river-mouth of Alexander’s time must have lain,
not at the western extremity of the sea-face of the Delta,
but much to the east of that point. From these remarks
(which I have abbreviated from the text), it will be seen
that Haidarâbâd can no longer be taken to be the modern
representative of Patala. Where then was the point at
which, in Alexander’s time, the Indus bifurcated, and
Patala was situated? Major-General Haig says that any
precise identification of this site is hardly within the limits
of possibility; but, for reasons for which his work itself
must be consulted, he is of opinion that “the ancient
capital of the Delta was most likely not far from a spot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
35 miles south-east of Haidarâbâd”—a spot which happens
to be 160 miles distant from each extremity of the Delta
coast, as supposed to have existed in Alexander’s time.
With regard to places which lie farther north than Patala,
the views set forth in this volume do not differ from those
of Major-General Haig. He is, however, of opinion that
the kingdom of Mousikanos was of greater extent than is
usually supposed, and must have embraced the district
of Bahawulpur, which answers better to the description of
that kingdom, as <i>the most flourishing in all India</i>, than the
country around Alôr.</p>

<p>The Delta tract, as taken in the <i>Memoir</i>, extends from
the sea northwards to the latitude of Haidarâbâd (25°
25´ N.), and is bounded on the east by the desert, the
Purân or old course of the Indus, now dry, and by the
Korî mouth, which is the Lonibare mouth of Ptolemy;
on the west by the outer border of the plains, where the
boundary runs S. by W. for 50 miles to near Thata, from
which point it turns almost due west, and runs for 60
miles more to the sea, near Karâchî. This alluvial tract
is everywhere furrowed by ancient channels, some continuous,
both above and throughout the Delta, and others
all but totally obliterated. Our author has a notice of
each of the more important of these channels. Regarding
the Ghâro, the western arm down which Alexander and his
fleet sailed, he says that it runs nearly east and west along
the southern border of the Kohistân (hill-country), that it
is thus on the extreme edge of the Delta, and that it has
a course of about 40 miles in length. Referring to the
present channel of the Indus, he remarks:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This divides the lower Delta region into two unequal
portions. Of these, the western, and much the smaller, portion
is in the form of an equilateral triangle, having sides of about
64 miles in length, consisting of the river, the coast-line, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
southern edge of the Kohistân plains, and including an area of
about 1700 square miles. This it will be convenient to call the
‘Western Delta,’ a name the more suitable that all the westward-flowing
branches of the river have, or have once had, their
mouths within the limits of the tract to which it will apply.”</p>

</div>

<p>A very interesting question is next discussed—that of
the secular extension of the Delta seaward—and the conclusion
arrived at, which is, however, conjectural, and
below the estimate of Colonel Holdich, is that from
Alexander’s time to 1869 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> the advance of the Delta
seaward has been eight miles, or at the rate of rather more
than six yards in a year, this being less than a fourth of the
growth of the Nile Delta in a not much greater period of
time.</p>

<p>We now proceed to show what new light we gain from
the <i>Memoir</i> respecting the voyage of Nearchos from the
naval station in the Indus to Alexander’s Haven, now
Karâchî. We abridge the account which Arrian has given
in his <i>Indika</i> of this part of the famous voyage:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Weighing from the Naval Station, the fleet reached Stoura,
about 100 stadia further down stream, and at the further
distance of 30 stadia came to another channel where the sea
was salt, at a place called Kaumana. A run of 20 stadia from
Kaumana brought it to Koreatis, where it anchored. After
weighing from this, a bar (ἕρμα) was encountered at the spot
where the Indus discharges into the sea, and through this, where
it was soft, a passage had to be cut at low water, for a space of
five stadia. On this part of the coast, which was rugged, the
waves dashed with great violence. The next place of anchorage
was at Krokala, a sandy island, which was reached after a course
of 150 stadia, that had followed the windings of the coast. Near
this dwelt the Arabies, who had their name from the river
Arabis, which separates their territory from that of the Oreitai.
On weighing from Krokala, a hill called Eiros lay to the right,
and to the left a low flat island, which stretched along the face
of the coast, and made the intervening creek narrow. The ships<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span>
having cleared this creek, reached a commodious harbour to
which Nearchos gave the name of “Alexander’s Haven.” At the
harbour’s mouth, two stadia off, lay an island named Bibakta,
which, acting as a barrier against the sea, caused the existence of
the harbour.</p>

</div>

<p>Our author thinks that some of the circumstances
described in the above passage supply irresistible evidence
that it was through the Ghâro that Nearchos sailed
into the sea. If the obstruction at the mouth of the
river was caused in part by rock, it is certain, he says,
that that mouth cannot have been situated to the east of
the Ghâro, for along the whole sea-border of the Delta, to
a depth of several miles, no rock, not even a stone, is to
be found. The description again of the coast adjoining
the bar as rugged or rocky (τραχεῖα) can apply with great
propriety to the plain west of the Ghâro, consisting, as it
does, of a compact gravelly soil, frequently broken by
outcropping rock, while the description would be utterly
out of place if applied to the low mud-banks of the actual
Delta coast. And further, the statement that the fleet,
after leaving the river, ran a winding course, shows very
pointedly that the Ghâro must have been the mouth by
which the fleet reached the sea, since, if it had issued from
any of the mouths east of the Ghâro, there would have
been no windings to follow, the coast of the Delta being
singularly straight and regular. The fleet probably
entered the sea by the creek of the Ghâro known as
the Kudro, not far from the present mouth of which there
is a small port named the Wâghûdar, accessible to riverboats
of light draught. Sir A. Burnes, however, who
visited the Delta in 1831, took the Pitî channel to have
been that by which Nearchos gained the sea. He had
seen in that channel what he took to be a rock, and concluded
that it was the obstacle which Nearchos had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span>
encountered. It was not a rock, however, but probably
an oyster-bank, for when search was made for it afterwards
during a survey it was no longer to be found.</p>

<p>The island of Krokala, which General Cunningham
erroneously identified with the island of Kîâmârî, which
lies in front of Karâchî, no longer exists as an island, but
forms part of the mainland. It lay at the mouth of the Gisri
Creek, by which the Malîr river pours its waters into the
sea. The headland which Arrian calls Eiros is to be
identified with the eminence called “Clifton,” the eastern
headland of Karâchî Bay, the “narrow creek” which the
fleet entered on leaving Krokala, is Chinî Creek, which
leads into Karâchî Bay and harbour. Kîâmârî thus
corresponds with the “low, flat island” of the Greek
narrative, while Manora (mistaken by Cunningham for
Eiros), exactly corresponds with Bibakta.</p>

<p>We must now briefly notice what is said regarding the
eastern portion of the Delta. Here the most important of
all the forsaken channels of the Indus is the Purân, which
can still be clearly traced from two different starting-points
in Central Sindh, one 24, the other 36 miles north-east
of Haidarâbâd. The two head channels run south-east
for about 50 miles, and unite at a spot 45 miles east
by south from Haidarâbâd. The single channel has then
a course of over 140 miles to the head of the Korî Creek,
the last 50 miles being through the Ran of Kuchchha.
The eastern arm of the Indus, which Alexander in person
explored, was probably some channel running into the
Purân not far above the point where it enters the
Ran. On reaching the sea by this eastern branch, Alexander,
as Arrian informs us, landed, and with some cavalry
proceeded three marches along the coast. This statement
the <i>Memoir</i> declares to be a fabrication, since such a march
would be an utter impossibility. At the same time, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span>
notion of wells being dug in the locality is scouted as an
absurdity.</p>

<p>The <i>Memoir</i> further indicates the route by which Alexander,
after starting from Patala to return homewards,
reached the Arabis or Arabios—now the Purâli river,
which flows through Lus Bela, and discharges into
Sonmiyâni Bay. The eastern frontier of the Arabios
lay near Krokala, and was very probably formed by
the river called the Malîr. Alexander, according to
Curtius, reached this frontier in a nine-days’ march from
Patala, and the western frontier, which was about 65
miles distant from the other, in five days more. Our
author, assuming that Alexander would not have marched
his army across the comparatively waterless plain of the
Kohistân, but would keep, if possible, within easy reach
of the river or one of its branches, thinks it obvious that
the earlier part of the route would follow the branch which
ran westward—the branch, namely, of which the Kalrî and
Ghâro formed the lower portion. From the position
which he assigns to Patala, the distance traversed in the
nine-days’ march would be 117 miles, while the point
on the Malîr where Alexander encamped would be, he
thinks, 7 or 8 miles east by north from Karâchî cantonments.
The distance between the Malîr and the Purâli,
it must be pointed out, is much greater now than it was
in Alexander’s time, for, like the Indus, the Purâli has
shifted its course far westward. The coast-line, moreover,
at Sonmiyâni has advanced 20 miles, if not more, since
then. Our author, therefore, placing the mouth of the
river rather to the north of the latitude of Liâri, suggests
that the point where the army reached the Arabios was
about 10 miles east by north from Liâri, and 20 miles
north or north by east from Sonmiyâni.</p>

<p>The last Appendix in the <i>Memoir</i> is devoted to a review<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>
of the narrative of the voyage by which Nearchos in six
days reached the mouth of the Arabios or Purâli from
Alexander’s Haven. It states in the outset that the discovery
of the great advance of the coast about the head
of Sonmiyâni Bay serves to explain some difficulties in
the account of the voyage which have hitherto defied
solution. We here abridge that account:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The fleet, on weighing from the haven, ran a course of 60
stadia, and anchored under shelter of a desert island called
Domai. Next day, with a run of 300 stadia, it reached Saranga,
and on the following day anchored at a desert place called
Sakala. Another run of 300 stadia brought it on the morrow
to Morontobara or Women’s Haven. This haven had a narrow
entrance, but was deep, capacious, and well-sheltered. The
fleet, before gaining the entrance, had passed through between
two islets, which lay so close to each other that the oars grazed
the rocks on each side. On leaving this harbour next day it had
on the left a tree-covered island 70 stadia long which sheltered
it from the violence of the sea. As the channel, however, which
separated the island from the mainland was narrow, and shoal
with ebb-tide, the passage through it was difficult and tedious,
and it was not till near the dawn of the following day that the
fleet succeeded in clearing it. A course of 120 stadia brought
it to a good harbour at the mouth of the Arabios. Not far from
this harbour lay an island described as being high and bare.</p>

</div>

<p>The island of Domai Colonel Holdich and others would
identify with Manora. Manora, however, Haig points out,
is even now 4 to 5 miles off from the nearest mainland,
and must have been further in Alexander’s time. He
would, therefore, place Domai rather more than 4 miles
due west of the town of Karâchî, or perhaps further north.
The fleet, in its course to Saranga, must have rounded
Cape Monze or Râs Muâri, but this projection is not
mentioned by Arrian. The position of Saranga, to judge
from the recorded length of the run, must have been near
the mouth of the Hub river, which is 26 miles distant from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span>
the position assigned to Domai. The Hub mouth has
been silted up, and this led, last century, to its port being
abandoned. Our author points out that if Κ were substituted
for Σ in Saranga, we would then have in Karanga
a very fair representation of Kharok, the name of the Hub
port. However this may be, he adds, there can be no
doubt that the Saranga of Nearchos was either at the
Hub mouth or a few miles further north.</p>

<p>He then corrects a mistake into which Dr. Vincent and
myself had both of us fallen in our respective translations
of the record of the next part of the voyage—that from
Saranga to Sakala, and thence to Morontobara. Our
versions represented the two rocky islets, between which
the fleet passed instead of taking a circuitous course out
in the open sea, as being in the neighbourhood of Sakala
instead of that of Morontobara. Sakala, Haig thinks, may
be placed a little east of Bidok Lak—a place 24 miles
distant from Saranga, if Saranga be taken to lie a few
miles north of the Hub mouth. Between these two places
the fleet must have passed the island of Gadâni, which is
now a part of the mainland, and was probably the Kodanê
of Ptolemy.</p>

<p>With regard to Morontobara, our author agrees with
Colonel Holdich in thinking that it is now represented by
the great depression known as “Sirondha,” which, though
usually a fresh-water lake, is occasionally quite dry. This,
as the Colonel states, was at no very distant date a commodious
harbour or arm of the sea, which has extended
north in historic times at least as far as Liâri, and possibly
further. He adds that south-west of Liâri some of the
land formation is probably very ancient, and that westward
along the Makran coast there are many indications
of local changes. The distance from Bidok Lak to the
depression is estimated at about 27 miles, which represents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span>
very fairly the 300 stadia of the narrative. Liâri is
now about 20 miles distant from the sea.</p>

<p>On leaving the Arabios the fleet, coasting the shores of
the Oreitai, arrived at Kôkala, a place near Râs Kachar,
where Nearchos landed, and was joined by the division of
the army under Leonnatus, from whom he received a
supply of provisions for his ships. From Kôkala, a course
of 500 stadia brought him to the estuary of the Tomêros,
or, as it is now called, the river Hingol. All connection
between the fleet and the army was thenceforth lost until
the district of Harmozia, in Karmania, was reached. The
coast of the Oreitai extended westward from the Arabios
to the great rocky headland of Malan, which still bears
the name given to it in Arrian, Malana—a distance of
fully 100 miles. The desolate shores of the Ichthyophagi
succeeded, and inland lay the vast sandy wastes of
Gedrosia. Between Cape Malan and the mouth of the
Anamis river in Harmozia, from which Nearchos, with a
small retinue, proceeded inland to meet Alexander, no
fewer than twenty-one names of places at which the fleet
touched are recorded in the narrative of the voyage.
Most of these have been identified by Major Mockler, the
political agent of Makrân. We can refer to only one or
two of the more notable. From Cape Malan the fleet
proceeded to Bagisâra, which, Colonel Holdich tells us, is
likely enough the Dimizaar or eastern bay of the Urmara
headland. The Pasiris, who are mentioned as a people
of this neighbourhood, have left frequent traces of their
existence along the coast. At Kalama, now Khor
Khalmat, which was reached on the second day from
Urmara, there can be traced a very considerable extension
of the land seawards, which would have completely altered
the course of the fleet from the present coasting tract.
The island of Karbine, which was distant 100 stadia from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span>
Kalama, cannot, our author points out, be the island of
Astola, but is probably a headland now connected with
the mainland by a low sandy waste. Astola, however, he
takes to be the island sacred to the sun, which Arrian
calls Nosala, and places at a distance of 100 stadia from
the mainland. The nearest land to it is Ras Jaddi or
Koh Zarên, in the neighbourhood of which was Mosarna,
where Nearchos took on board a pilot, by whom thenceforth
the course of the fleet was directed. The next place
of importance was Barna, called by others Bâdara, and
this Mockler identifies with Gwâdar. The following
identifications succeed:—Dendrobosa with the west
point of Gwâdar headland, Kôphas with Pishikân Bay,
Bagia with Cape Brês, Tâlmena with a harbour in
Chahbar Bay, Kanate with Karatee, Dagasira with
Jakeisar, near the mouth of the Jageen river, Bâdis with
Kôh Mubârak, and the mouth of the Anamis river with
a point north by east from the island of Ormus. The
distances which Arrian records as run by the fleet from
day to day are generally excessive, especially after it had
left the mouth of the Arabios.</p>

<p>We must now resume consideration of the movements
of Alexander himself. When we left him he had reached
the banks of the Arabios, at a point distant some twenty
miles from Sonmiyâni, or perhaps even higher up the
river. On crossing the stream he turned to his left
towards the sea, and with a picked force made a sudden
descent on the Oreitai. After a night’s march he came to
a well-inhabited district, defeated the Oreitai, and penetrated
to their capital—a mere village called Rambakia,
which Colonel Holdich places at or near Khairkot. The
Oreitai themselves are, in his opinion, represented by
the Lumri tribes of Las Bela, who are of Rajput descent.
From Rambakia Alexander proceeded with a part of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span>
troops to force the narrow pass which the Gadrôsoi and
the Oreitai had conjointly seized with the design of
stopping his progress. This defile was most probably the
turning pass at the northern end of the Hala range. The
Gadrôsoi seem to owe their name to the Gadurs, one of
the Lumri clans, from which, however, they hold themselves
somewhat distinct. Alexander, after clearing the
pass, pushed on through a desert country into the territory
of the Gadrôsoi, and drew down to the coast. He must
then, says our author, have followed the valley of the
Phur to the coast, and pushed on along the track of the
modern telegraph line till he reached the neighbourhood
of the Hingol river, where he halted to collect supplies for
the fleet. On this part of the route were the tamarisk
trees which yielded myrrh, the mangrove swamps, the
euphorbias with prickly shoots, and the roots of spikenard.</p>

<p>Beyond this he could no longer pursue his march along
the coast in order to keep in touch with the fleet. The
huge barrier of the Malan range, which abutted direct on
the sea, stopped his way. There was no goat track in
those days, such as, after infinite difficulty, helped the
telegraph line over. He was consequently forced into the
interior. Taking the only route that was possible, he
followed up the Hingol till he could turn the Malan by
the first available pass westward. Nothing here, we are
told, has altered since his days. The magnificent peaks
and mountains which surround the sacred shrine of
Hinglaz are “everlasting hills,” and it was through these
that he proceeded to make his way. The windings of the
Hingol river he followed for 40 miles up to its junction
with the Parkan. The bed of this stream leads westward
from the Hingol, and skirts the north of the Taloi range.
Alexander had thus for the first time a chance of turning
the Malan block, and directing his march westward to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix"></a>[xxix]</span>
sea. He therefore pushed his way through this low valley,
which was flanked by the Taloi hills, that rose on his left
to a height of 2000 feet. All the region at their base was
a wilderness of sandy hillocks and scanty grass-covered
waste, which could afford his troops no supplies and no
shelter from the fierce autumn heat. All the miseries of his
retreat, which are so graphically depicted by his historians,
were concentrated into the distance between the Hingol
and the point where he regained the coast. The Parkan
route should have led him to the river Basol, but having
lost his way, he must have emerged near the harbour of
Pasnî, almost on the line of the present telegraph. The
distance from the Hingol to Pasnî our author estimates at
about 200 miles; but in Curzon’s well-known map of
Persia it appears as if only 150.</p>

<p>From Pasnî Alexander marched for seven days along
the coast till he reached the well-known highway to
Karmania. He could only leave the coast near the Dasht
river and strike into the valley of the Bahu, which would
lead him to Bampur, the capital of Gadrosia. This part
of the march probably occupied nearly a month. It has
been doubted whether Bampur was, in Alexander’s time,
the capital of Gadrosia, rather than the place on the edge
of the Kirman desert, called indifferently Fahraj, Purag,
and Pura, where there are extensive ruins of a very
ancient date. Colonel Holdich, however, adduces arguments
which suffice to set aside the claims advanced in
favour of Fahraj. Bampur is as old as Fahraj, and has in
its neighbourhood the site of a city still older, and now
called Pura and Purag. Besides, in order to reach Fahraj,
Alexander must have passed Bampur, since there is no
other way consistent with Arrian’s account. With regard
to the route pursued by Krateros with the heavy transport
and invalids, our author points out that it was probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx"></a>[xxx]</span>
by the Mulla (and not the Bolan) pass to Kelat and
Quetta. Thence he must have taken the Kandahar
route to the Helmund, and followed that river down to
the fertile plains of lower Seistan, whence he crossed the
Kirman desert by a well-known modern caravan route
and joined Alexander at or near Kirman.</p>

<p>Since the publication of his lecture, of which we have
thus summarised the contents, Colonel Holdich has contributed
to the <i>Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</i>
(January 1896), an article on “The Origin of the Kafîr of
the Hindu-Kush,” which contains some very interesting
notices regarding Alexander as he fought his way from the
Hindu-Kush to the banks of the Indus. The route by
which the conqueror himself advanced with one division
of his army, while the other division, which was more
heavily armed, advanced by the Khaibar Pass, is thus
described by our author:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The recognised road to India from Central Asia was that
which passed through the plains of Kabul, by the Kabul river,
into Laghmân or Lamghân, and thence by the open Dasht-i-Gumbaz
into the lower Kunar. From the Kunar valley this road,
even to the time of Baber’s invasion of India (early in the
sixteenth century), crossed the comparatively low intervening
range into Bajour; thence to the valley of the Panj-Kora and
Swat, and out into India by the same passes with which we have
now (after nearly 400 years) found it convenient to enter the
same district.”</p>

</div>

<p>A reference to our notes, B. C. D. E., in the <a href="#APPENDICES">Appendix</a>,
will show that this view of the route is that which we
ourselves had adopted. His views with regard to the
position of Massaga, Aornos, and Embolima are also
coincident with those at which we had arrived. Dyrta he
takes to have been the place now known as Dir. That
opinion was held by such great authorities as Court and
Lassen, but we have pointed out an objection to it in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi"></a>[xxxi]</span>
<a href="#Footnote_62">p. 76, n. 3</a>. To Nysa, which, as will be seen by a reference
to our long note <a href="#NoteG">pp. 338-340</a>, we have identified with the
Nagara or Dionysopolis of Ptolemy (B. vii., 43), thus
placing it at a distance of four or five miles west of
Jalâlâbâd and near the Kabul river, Colonel Holdich
assigns a different locality.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Nysaeans,” he says, “whose city Alexander spared, were
the descendants of those conquerors, who, coming from the
west, were probably deterred by the heat of the plains of India
from carrying their conquests south of the Punjab. They
settled on the cool and well-watered slopes of those mountains
which crown the uplands of Swat and Bajour, where they cultivated
the vine for generations.... It seems possible that they
may have extended their habitat as far eastward as the upper
Swat valley and the mountain region of the Indus, and at one
time may have occupied the site of the ancient capital of the
Assakenoi, Massaga, which there is reason to suppose stood in
about the position now occupied by the town of Manglaor.”</p>

</div>

<p>The hill in the neighbourhood of Nysa called Mount
Mêros, which was clad with ivy, laurel, and vine-trees, he
identifies with the Koh-i-Mor or Mountain of Mor, and
gives this account of it:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the right bank of the Panj-Kora river (the ancient
Ghoura), nearly opposite to its junction with the river of Swat
(Suastos), is a very conspicuous mountain, whose three-headed
outline can be distinctly seen from the Peshawar cantonment,
known as the Koh-i-Mor or Mountain of Mor. On the southern
slopes of this mountain, near the foot of it, is a large scattered
village called Nuzar or Nasar. The sides of the mountain
spurs are clothed with the same forest and jungle that is common
to the mountains of Kafiristan, and to the hills intervening
between Kafiristan and the Koh-i-Mor. Amid this jungle are to
be found the wild vine and ivy.”</p>

</div>

<p>In <a href="#NoteB">note B.</a>—Nikaia—page 332, some remarks will be
found regarding the Kafîrs. Colonel Holdich describes
them similarly, but upholds the view, rejected by Elphinstone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxii"></a>[xxxii]</span>
of their Greek origin. The best known of them, he
points out, are the Kamdesh Kafîrs from the lower valley
of the Bashgol, a large affluent of the Kunar river, which
it joins from the north-west, some forty miles below
Chitral. He then continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the case of the Kamdesh Kafîr, at least, the tradition of
Greek or Pelasgic origin seems likely to be verified in a very
remarkable way. Scientific inquiry has been converging on
him from several directions, and it seems possible that the
ethnographical riddle connected with his existence will be solved
ere long. In appearance he is of a distinct Aryan type, with
low forehead, and prominent aquiline features, entirely free from
Tartar or Mongolian traits; his eyes, though generally dark, are
frequently of a light grey colour; his complexion is fair enough
to pass for Southern European; his figure is always slight, but
indicating marvellous activity and strength; and the modelling
of his limbs would furnish study for a sculptor.”</p>

</div>

<p>Colonel Holdich subsequently calls our attention to
certain strange inscriptions found in the valley of the Indus
east of Swat, and engraved, most of them, on stone slabs
built into towers which are now in ruins. These inscriptions,
on being subjected to a congress of Orientalists, were
pronounced to be in an unknown tongue. They may
possibly, he adds, be found to be vastly more ancient than
the towers they adorned, it being, at any rate, a notable
fact about them that some of them “recall a Greek alphabet
of archaic type.” He concludes his observations
regarding the Kafîrs in these terms: “I cannot but believe
them to be the modern representatives of that very
ancient western race, the Nysaeans—so ancient that the
historians of Alexander refer to their origin as mythical.”</p>

<p>I may, in conclusion, advert, in a word, to an article
of great ability, contributed to the <i>Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society</i> for October 1894, in which the writer
endeavours to show that Alexander reached the Indus by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiii"></a>[xxxiii]</span>
a widely different route from that which is indicated in
our pages, although it is also the route which, in its main
outlines, has been determined by the best authorities—men
of high military rank, personally acquainted with the
country, and scholars of the greatest eminence. As the
selection of the route advocated was mainly based on
the opinion which the writer had formed as to the
point whereat Alexander had effected his passage of the
Indus, it will suffice to refute his theory if we prove
that his opinion is altogether untenable. In his view, the
Indus was crossed, not at Attock, but much higher up
stream, at a point between Amb and the mouth of the
Barhind river, the Parenos of the Greeks. Now, while the
passage at Attock is that which, from time immemorial,
has been used as the easiest means of access into India
from the west, the passage higher up is much more difficult
and dangerous, for though the river is not there so
wide, its current is much more impetuous, while the banks
are, at the same time, much steeper. Had Alexander
notwithstanding attempted to cross at that point, he
would have had to encounter a desperate resistance on
the part of his determined enemy Abisares, in whose
dominions he would have found himself on reaching the
eastern bank. He made, however, no such foolhardy
attempt either here or afterwards at the Hydaspes. We
find, as a matter of fact, that when he made the passage
he met with no opposition, but was most hospitably
received by his vassal, the King of Taxila, in whose
dominions Attock was situated. The writer, it would
appear, has been led to his erroneous assumption by
applying to the Indus <i>specially</i> the remark in Strabo
(quoted at page 64, note 4) regarding the rivers of
Northern Afghânistân <i>generally</i>, that Alexander wished
to cross them as near their sources as possible. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv"></a>[xxxiv]</span>
remark, we may be certain, had no reference to the Indus
at all, for Alexander could not but have learned from
Taxiles, who had joined him at Nikaia before the two
divisions of his army separated, where the Indus could
best be crossed. Taxiles, moreover, accompanied the
division which advanced towards the Indus by the
Khaibar Pass, with instructions to make all the necessary
preparations for the passage of the whole army. Could
such instructions have been given if the point where the
passage was to be made had still to be discovered? A
reference to Baber’s <i>Memoirs</i> will show with what ease
that other great conqueror transported his army into
India by using the Attock passage.</p>

<p>This work is the fifth of a series which may be entitled
<i>Ancient India as described by the Classical Writers</i>, since
it was projected to supply annotated translations of all
the accounts of India which have descended to us from
classical antiquity. The volumes which have already
appeared contain the fragments of the <i>Indika</i> of Ktêsias
the Knidian, and of the <i>Indika</i> of Megasthenês, the <i>Indika</i>
of Arrian, the <i>Periplous of the Erythraian Sea</i> by an unknown
author, and Ptolemy’s <i>Geography of India and the
other Countries of Eastern Asia</i>. A sixth work, containing
translations of the chapters in Strabo’s <i>Geography</i> which
describe <i>India and Ariana</i>, is in preparation, and will
complete the series. I cannot at present say whether
this work will appear as a separate publication, or will be
included in a volume containing new and revised editions
of the three <i>Indikas</i> mentioned above, which are now
nearly out of print, as are also the other two works of the
series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi"></a>[xxxvi]</span></p>

<p>In the present work I have translated and annotated
all the earliest and most authentic records which have
been preserved of the Macedonian invasion of India under
Alexander the Great. The notes do not touch on points
either of grammar or of textual criticism, but are mainly
designed to illustrate the statements advanced in the
narratives. When short, they accompany the text as
footnotes, and when of such a length as would too much
encumber the pages, they have been placed together in
an appendix by themselves. Such notes again as refer to
<i>persons</i> have been placed, whether short or long, in a second
appendix, which I have designated a <i>Biographical Appendix</i>.</p>

<p>In preparing the translations and notes I have consulted

<p>The Translations are strictly literal, but though such,
will, I trust, be found to give, without crudeness of diction,
a faithful reflex not only of the sense, but also of the
spirit, force, fluency, and perspicuity of the original compositions.
I have at all events spared no pains to
combine in the translations the two merits of being at
once literal and idiomatic in expression.</p>

<p>In translating Arrian I adopted the text of Sintenis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxviii"></a>[xxxviii]</span>
(2nd edition, Berlin, 1863); and with regard to Curtius,
I found the work entitled <i>Alexander in India</i>, edited by
Heitland and Raven, very serviceable, containing, as it
does, exactly that portion of Curtius which it was my
purpose to translate. Both the works referred to contain
valuable <i>prolegomena</i> and notes, to which I must here
acknowledge my obligations.</p>

<p>The Introduction consists of two parts. In the first,
I have pointed out the sources whence our knowledge
of the history of Alexander has been derived, and discussed
their title to credibility; while in the second, I
have sketched Alexander’s career, and added a very brief
summary of the events that followed his death till the
wars for the division of his empire were finally composed.</p>

<p>In the transcription of Greek proper names I have
followed as hitherto the method introduced by Grote,
which scholars have now generally adopted. A vindication
of the method which, to my thinking, is unanswerable,
has appeared in the preface to Professor Freeman’s <i>History
of Sicily</i>, a work which the author unfortunately has not
lived to complete.</p>

<p>The most noticeable change resulting from this method
is the substitution of <i>K</i> for <i>C</i> in the spelling of Greek
names. This should be borne in mind by those who may
have occasion to consult either the Biographical Appendix
or the General Index. I may further note that in transcribing
Sanskrit or other Indian names I have in all
cases used the circumflex to distinguish the long <i>â</i>, which
is sounded as <i>a</i> in <i>fall</i>, from the short <i>a</i>, which is sounded
as <i>u</i> in <i>dumb</i>. In Sanskrit and its derivative dialects this
short vowel (अ) is never written unless it begin a word,
for it is supposed to be inherent in every consonant. The
letter <i>ś</i> with the acute accent represents the palatal
sibilant (श), which is sounded like <i>sh</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxix"></a>[xxxix]</span></p>

<p>Two maps accompany the work, the larger of which
shows the entire line of the route which Alexander
followed in the course of his Asiatic expedition, while the
smaller shows more distinctly that part of his route which
lay through the northern parts of Afghânistân and the
Country of the Five Rivers. For both I consulted the
latest and most authoritative maps, both British and
German, in which these routes have been laid down, and
I found them in pretty close agreement, except with
regard to that part of the route which is traced in the
smaller map. Here I have generally followed the
sketch map of the Panjâb which is given in General
Cunningham’s <i>Ancient Geography of India</i>, but have
ventured to differ from him with regard to the position
of the Rock Aornos, of Alexander’s bridge over the Indus,
of Sangala, and of the Oxydrakai, whom I have placed,
as in Sir E. H. Bunbury’s map, to the south of the Malloi.</p>

<p>The frontispiece to the volume, reproduced from a
fifteenth-century French MS. of the Life of Alexander,
may, it is hoped, appeal to many as a quaint rendering of
a widely “popular” incident.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude without expressing my great
obligations to Mr. Archibald Constable, by whose firm
this work is published, for all the trouble he has taken
in connection with its passage through the press, and
especially with the preparation of the illustrations. I
have also to thank Dr. Burgess for supplying the photograph
from which the Aśôka inscription on <a href="#Page_373">page 373</a>
has been reproduced, and for sundry valuable suggestions
besides.</p>

<p>“Of the life of Alexander we have five consecutive narratives, besides
numerous allusions and fragments scattered up and down various Greek and
Latin writers.... Unluckily, among all the five there is not a single contemporary
chronicler.... The value of all, it is clear, must depend upon
the faithfulness with which they represent the earlier writings which they
had before them, and upon the amount of critical power which they may have
brought to bear upon their examination. Unluckily again, among all the five,
one only has any claim to the name of a critic. Arrian alone seems to have
had at once the will and the power to exercise a discreet judgment upon the
statements of those who went before him. Diodôros we believe to be perfectly
honest, but he is, at the same time, impenetrably stupid. Plutarch,
as he himself tells us, does not write history, but lives; his object is rather
to gather anecdotes, to point a moral, than to give a formal narrative of
political and military events. Justin is a feeble and careless epitomizer.
Quintus Curtius is, in our eyes, little better than a romance writer; he is the
only one of the five whom we should suspect of any wilful departure from the
truth.”—From <i>Historical Essays</i>, by Professor Freeman, 2d series, third

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>The invasion of India by Alexander the Great, like the
first voyage of Columbus to America, was the means of
opening up a new world to the knowledge of mankind.
Before the great conqueror visited that remote and
sequestered country, which was then thought to lie at
the utmost ends of the earth, nothing was known regarding
it beyond a few vague particulars mentioned by
Herodotos, and such grains of truth as could be sifted
from the mass of fictions which formed the staple of the
treatise on India written by Ktêsias of Knidos. A comparison
of this work with the <i>Indika</i> of Megasthenes,
which was written after the invasion, will show how
entirely all real knowledge of the country was due to that
event. It may even, we think, be asserted that had that
invasion not taken place, the knowledge of India among
the nations of the West would not have advanced much
beyond where Ktêsias left it, until the maritime passage
to the East by the Cape of Good Hope had been discovered.</p>

<p>It was early in the year 326 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> that Alexander, fresh
from the conquest of the fierce tribes of northern Afghânistân,
led his army over into the plains of India by a
bridge of boats, with which he had spanned the Indus a
little below its junction with the Kabul river.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He remained
in the country not more than twenty months all told, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
in that brief space he reduced the Panjâb as far as the
Satlej, and the whole of the spacious valley of the lower
Indus, downwards to the ocean itself. He would even
have penetrated to the Ganges had his army consented to
follow him, and, in the opinion of Sandrokottos, would
have succeeded in adding to his empire the vast regions
through which that river flows. The rapidity with which
he achieved his actual conquests in the country appears
all the more surprising when we take into account that
at every stage of his advance he encountered a most
determined resistance. The people were not only of a
most martial temperament, but were at the same time
inured to arms; and had they but been united and led
by such a capable commander as Pôros, the Macedonian
army was doomed to utter destruction. Alexander, with
all his matchless strategy, could not have averted such a
catastrophe; for what is the record of his Indian campaigns?
We find that the toughest of all his battles was that which
he fought on the banks of the Hydaspes against Pôros;
that he had hot work in overcoming the resistance of the
Kathaians before the walls of Sangala; that he was
wounded near to death in his assault upon the Mallian
stronghold; and that in the valley of the Indus he could
only overpower the opposition instigated by the Brahmans
by means of wholesale massacres and executions. It may
hence be safely inferred that if Alexander had found India
united in arms to withstand his aggression, the star of his
good fortune would have culminated with his passage of
the Indus. But he found, on the contrary, the political condition
of the country when he entered it eminently favourable
to his designs. The regions of the Indus and its
great tributary streams were then divided into separate
states—some under kingly and others under republican
governments, but all alike prevented by their mutual
jealousies and feuds from acting in concert against a
common enemy, and therefore all the more easy to overcome.
Alexander, in pursuance of his usual policy, sought
to secure the permanence of his Indian conquests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
by founding cities,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which he strongly fortified and
garrisoned with large bodies of troops to overawe and
hold in subjection the tribes in their neighbourhood.
The system of government also which he established was
the same as that which he had provided for his other
subject provinces, the civil administration being entrusted
to native chiefs, while the executive and military authority
was wielded by Macedonian officers.</p>

<p>The Asiatic nations in general submissively acquiesced
in the new order of things, and after a time found no
reason to regret the old order which it had superseded.
Under their Hellenic masters they enjoyed a greater
measure of freedom than they had ever before known;
commerce was promoted, wealth increased, the administration
of justice improved, and altogether they reached a
higher level of culture, both intellectual and moral, than
they could possibly have attained under a continuance of
Persian supremacy.</p>

<p>India did not participate to any great extent in these
advantages. Her people were too proud and warlike to
brook long the burden and reproach of foreign thraldom,
and within a few years after the Conqueror’s death they
completely freed themselves from the yoke he imposed,
and were thereafter ruled by their native princes. The
Greek occupation having thus proved so transient, had
little more effect in shaping the future course of the
national destinies than a casual raid of Scottish borderers
into Cumberland in the old days could have had in shaping
the general course of English history.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>By this disruption of her relations with the rest of
Alexander’s empire, India fell back into her former isolation
from all the outside world, and for more than fifteen
or sixteen centuries afterwards the western nations knew
as little of her internal condition as they knew till lately
of the interior of the Dark Continent. The invasion was,
however, by no means fruitless of some good results. As
has been already indicated, it drew aside the veil which
had till then shrouded India from the observation of the
rest of the world, and it thus widened the horizon of
knowledge. It is fortunate that what then became known
of India was not left for its preservation at the mercy of
mere oral tradition, but was committed to the safer custody
of writing. Not a few of Alexander’s officers and companions
were men of high attainments in literature and
science, and some of their number composed memoirs of
his wars, in the course of which they recorded their impressions
of India and the races by which they found it
inhabited.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> These reports, even in the fragmentary state
in which they have come down to us, have proved of inestimable
value to scholars engaged in the investigation of Indian
antiquity—a task which the sad deficiency of Sanskrit
literature in history and chronology has rendered one of
no ordinary difficulty. Strabo, we must however note,
stigmatized the authors referred to as being in general a
set of liars, of whom only a few managed now and then
to stammer out some words of truth. This sweeping
censure is, however, a most egregious calumny. It may
indeed be admitted that their descriptions are not uniformly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
free from error or exaggeration, and may even be
tainted by some intermixture of fiction, but on the whole
they wrote in good faith—a fact which even Strabo himself
practically admits by frequently citing their authority
for his statements. If one or two of them are to some
extent liable to the censure, it must be remembered that
Ptolemy, Aristoboulos, Nearchos, Megasthenes, and others
of them, are writers of unimpeachable veracity.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the works in which these
writers recorded their Indian experiences have all, without
exception, perished. We know, however, the main substance
of their contents from the histories of Alexander,
written several centuries after his death by the authors
we have here translated, as well as from Strabo, Pliny,
Ailianos, Athênaios, Orosius, and others.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Arrian</span></h3>

<p>Arrian, who is universally allowed to be by far the best
of all Alexander’s historians, was at once a philosopher,
a statesman, a military commander, an expert in the
tactics of war, and an accomplished writer. He was
born towards the end of the first century of our aera at
Nikomêdeia (now Ismiknid or Ismid), the capital of
Bithynia, situated near the head of a deep bay at the
south-eastern end of the Propontis or Sea of Marmora.
He became a disciple of the Stoic philosopher Epiktêtos
(much in the same way as Xenophon attached himself to
Sôkrates), and gave to the world an abstract of his
master’s lectures, together with an <i>Encheiridion</i> or manual
of his philosophy—a work which was long and widely
popular. Under the Emperor Hadrian he was appointed
in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 132 prefect of Kappadokia. He had not long
filled this office when a large body of wild Alan horsemen
made one of their formidable raids into his province.
They had hitherto proved irresistible, but on this occasion
they were completely foiled by the skilful strategy and
tactics of Arrian, who expelled them from his borders before
they had secured any plunder. In Rome he was preferred
to various high offices, and under Antoninus Pius was raised
to the consulship. In his later years he retired to his
native city, where he occupied himself in composing
treatises on a considerable variety of subjects, but chiefly
on history and geography. He died at an advanced age
in the reign of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.</p>

<p>His account of Alexander’s Asiatic expedition was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
followed by a treatise on India called the <i>Indika</i>. The
first part of this work, which gives a description of India
and its people, was based chiefly on the <i>Indika</i> of Megasthenes;
and the second part, which narrates the famous
voyage of Nearchos from the mouth of the Indus to the
head of the Persian Gulf, was based on a journal kept by
Nearchos himself. The work is but a supplement to his
history. He speaks himself with noble pride of this great
work. “This I do assert,” he says, “that this historical
record of Alexander’s deeds is, and has been from my
youth up, in place to me of native land, family, and
honours of state; and so I do not regard myself as unworthy
to take rank among the foremost writers in the
Greek language, if Alexander be forsooth among the foremost
in arms.” “Quel délire de l’amour propre!” here
exclaims Sainte-Croix. His merits as an author are thus
well stated by a writer in Smith’s <i>Classical Dictionary</i>:
“This great work (the <i>Anabasis</i>) reminds the reader of
Xenophon’s <i>Anabasis</i>, not only by its title, but also by the
ease and clearness of its style.... Great as his merits
thus are as an historian, they are yet surpassed by his
excellences as an historical critic. His <i>Anabasis</i> is based
upon the most trustworthy historians among the contemporaries
of Alexander.... One of the great merits of
the work is the clearness and distinctness with which he
describes all military movements and operations, the
drawing up of the armies for battle, and the conduct of
battles and sieges.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Q. Curtius Rufus</span></h3>

<p>Nothing is known with any certainty respecting either
the life of this historian or the time at which he lived.
Niebuhr makes him contemporary with Septimius Severus,
but most critics with Vespasian. Zumpt again, who, like
some other eminent scholars, identifies him with the
rhetorician Q. Curtius Rufus, of whom Suetonius wrote a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
life now lost, places him as early as Augustus.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
style in which his history is written certainly shows
him to have been a consummate master of rhetoric. He
was particularly given to adorning his narrative with
speeches and public harangues, and these, as Zumpt
observes, are marked with a degree of power and effectiveness
which scarcely anything in that species of writing
can surpass. It may also be said that his style for
elegance does not fall much short of the perfection of
Cicero himself. It has of course its faults, and in these
can be traced the incipient degeneracy of the Latin
language, such as the introduction of poetical diction into
prose, the ambition of expressing everything pointedly
and strikingly, not to mention certain deviations from
strict grammatical propriety.</p>

<p>The materials of his narrative were drawn chiefly from
Ptolemy, who accompanied Alexander into India, from
Kleitarchos their contemporary, and from Timagenes, who
flourished in the reign of Augustus, and wrote an excellent
history of Alexander and his successors. While the
sources whence he derived his information were thus good
on the whole, he was himself deficient in the knowledge
of military tactics, geography, chronology, astronomy, and
especially in historical criticism, and he is therefore as an
historical authority far inferior to Arrian. But in perusing
his “pictured pages” the reader takes but little note
of his errors and inconsistencies, being fascinated with his
graceful and glowing narrative, interspersed as it is with
brilliant orations, sage maxims, sound moral reflections,
vivid descriptions of life and manners, and beautiful
estimates of character. It is not surprising that with
such merits Curtius has been one of the most popular of
the classical authors. In spite of all his sins, for which
he has so often been pilloried by the censors of literary
morals, his history of Alexander has been the delight and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
admiration of not a few of the greatest of European
scholars. He seems to have taken Livy as his model, as
Arrian took Xenophon for his. His work consisted
originally of ten books, but the first two are lost, and in
some of the others considerable gaps occur. The French
translation of Curtius by Vaugelas, who devoted thirty
years of his life to the task, is so remarkable for its
elegance that it has been pronounced to be as inimitable
as Alexander himself was invincible. It is not, however,
a very close version.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Plutarch</span></h3>

<p>There are but few works in the wide circle of literature
which have afforded so much instruction and entertainment
to the world as Plutarch’s <i>Parallel Lives of the
Famous Men of Greece and Rome</i>. These <i>Lives</i>, which
are forty-six in number, are arranged in pairs, and each
pair contains the <i>life</i> of a Greek and a Roman, followed,
though not always, by a comparison drawn between the
two. Alexander the Great and Caesar are ranked together,
but no comparison follows. In his introduction to
the <i>life</i> of the former, Plutarch explains his method as a
biographer. “We do not,” he says, “give the actions in
full detail and with a scrupulous exactness, but rather in a
short summary, since we are not writing <i>histories</i>, but
<i>lives</i>. It is not always in the most distinguished achievements
that men’s vices or virtues may be best discerned,
but often an action of but little note—a short saying or a
jest—may mark a person’s real character more than the
greatest sieges or the most important battles.” His <i>Lives</i>,
therefore, while useful to the writer of history, must be
used with care, since they are not intended as materials
for history. His narrative of Alexander’s progress through
India has one or two passages which show this indifference
to historical accuracy, as when, for instance, he states that
the soldiers of Alexander refused to pass the Ganges when
they saw the opposite bank covered with the army of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
King of the Praisians.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> His account of the battle with
Pôros is, however, excellent, and all the more interesting,
because, as he tells us, he obtained the particulars from
Alexander’s own letters.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Plutarch was a native of Chairôneia, a town in Boiôtia.
The date of his birth is unknown, but may be fixed
towards the middle of the first century of our aera. He
visited Italy, and lectured on philosophy in some of its
cities. For some time he lived in Rome, where, it is said,
but on doubtful authority, that he was promoted to high
offices of state, and became tutor to the Emperor Trajan.
The later years of his life he spent at Chairôneia, where
he discharged various magisterial offices and held a priesthood.
The date of his death, like that of his birth, is
unknown, but it is clear that he lived to an advanced age.
Besides the <i>Lives</i>, he published other writings, mostly
essays, having some resemblance to those of Bacon.
They are sixty in number, and are called collectively
<i>Moralia</i>, though some of them are of an historical character.
Two of them are orations <i>About the Fortune or
Virtue of Alexander</i>. His style is somewhat difficult, at
times cumbrous and involved, and somewhat deficient in
that grace and perspicuity for which the works of the
Attic writers are noted. His writings are all the more
valuable from their supplying a deficiency of the Greek
historians, whose works are filled with the records of war
and politics, while giving us but little insight into men’s
private lives and their social surroundings.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Diodoros the Sicilian</span></h3>

<p>Diodôros was born at Agyrium, a city in the interior
of Sicily, and was a contemporary of Julius Caesar and
the Emperor Augustus. It was the great ambition of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
life to write an universal history, and having this in view
he travelled over a great part of Europe and Asia in
order to acquire a more accurate knowledge of countries
and nations than could be obtained from merely reading
books. In Rome, where a far greater number of the
ancient documents which he required to consult had been
collected than were to be found elsewhere, he resided for
a considerable time. He spent thirty years in the composition
of his work, to which he gave the name of
<i>Bibliothêkê</i>, which indicated that it formed quite <i>a library</i>
in itself, embracing, as it did, the history of all ages and
all countries. It consisted of forty books, which he
divided into three great sections: 1st, the mythical
period previous to the Trojan war; 2d, the period thence
to the death of Alexander the Great; 3d, the period from
Alexander to the beginning of Caesar’s Gallic wars.
Considerable portions of the <i>Bibliothêkê</i> are lost, but all
the books relating to the period with which we are
concerned are still extant.</p>

<p>Diodôros constructed his narrative upon the plan of
annals, placing the events of each year side by side without
regard to their intrinsic connection. The value of
the work is greatly impaired by the author’s evident want
of critical discernment; he mixes up history with fiction,
shows frequently that he has misunderstood his authorities,
and advances statements which are mutually contradictory.
His style is, however, pleasing, having the
merits of simplicity and clearness. In his second book
he gives a description of India epitomized from Megasthenes.
His account of Alexander’s career in India
records some interesting particulars of which we should
otherwise have remained ignorant. He seems to have
drawn largely from the same sources as Curtius.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Justinus Frontinus</span></h3>

<p>Justin, in the preface to his work entitled <i>De Historiis
Philippicis</i>, informs us that it was “a kind of anthology”—<i>veluti<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
florum corpusculum</i>—extracted from the forty-four
volumes published by Pompeius Trogus on Philippic (<i>i.e.</i>
Macedonian) history. As these volumes included histories
of nearly all the countries with which the Macedonian
sovereigns had transactions, they embraced such a very
wide field that they were regarded as a cyclopaedia of
general history. Justin remarks that while many authors
regard it as an arduous task to write no more than the
history of one king or one state, we cannot but think
that Pompeius had the daring of Hercules in attacking
the whole world, seeing that in his books are contained
the <i>res gestae</i> of all ages, kings, nations, and peoples.
He then states that he had occupied his leisure while in
Rome by selecting those passages of Trogus which seemed
most worthy of being generally known, and passing over
such as he took to be neither particularly interesting nor
instructive. He has been much, but unjustly, blamed for
his omissions, seeing that his only object in writing was
to compile a work of elegant historical extracts. By so
doing he has rescued from oblivion many facts not elsewhere
recorded. From the extracts relating to India we
gather more information about Sandrokottos (Chandragupta)
than from any other classical source. Trogus Pompeius
belonged, we know, to the age of Augustus, but it is
uncertain when Justin lived. As the earliest writer by
whom he is mentioned is St. Jerome, his date cannot be
later than the beginning of the fifth century of our aera.</p>

</div>

<p>Alexander III., King of Macedonia, surnamed the
Great, was born at Pella in the year 356 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> He was
the son of Philip II. and Olympias, who belonged to
the royal race of Epeiros, which claimed to be descended
from Achilles, the hero of the <i>Iliad</i>. The education of
the prince was in the outset entrusted to Lysimachos,
an Akarnanian, and to his mother’s kinsman Leonidas,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
a man of an austere character, who inured his pupil to
Spartan-like habits of hard exercise and simple fare.
In his thirteenth year he was placed under the immediate
tuition of Aristotle, who acquired a life-long influence
over the mind and character of his pupil. It may
be supposed that the eager love of discovery which
conspicuously distinguished Alexander from ordinary
conquerors was in a great measure inspired and stimulated
by the precepts of his master. In his sixteenth year he
was entrusted, during his father’s absence on a foreign
expedition, with the regency of Macedonia; and two
years later, at the battle of Chaironeia, which was won
chiefly through his impetuous valour, he displayed for
the first time his incomparable genius for war. This
victory made the Macedonian King supreme in Greece,
and at a convention which met soon afterwards at his
summons, and which was attended by deputies from all
the Grecian states except Sparta, he was appointed to
command the national forces and to conduct an expedition
against Persia to avenge the invasions of Mardonios and
Xerxes. He was actively engaged in preparing for this
great contest when he fell by the hand of an assassin.
Alexander succeeded (336 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) not only to his sovereignty,
but also to his supremacy in the affairs of Greece. He
found himself, immediately on his accession, beset on all
sides with most formidable opponents. Attalos, who
was in Asia with a considerable force under his command,
aspired to the throne; the Greeks, instigated by the
passionate eloquence of Demosthenes, attempted to liberate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
themselves from Macedonian dictation, and the barbarians
of the north threatened his hereditary dominions with
invasion. The youthful monarch was equal to the emergency.
He at once seized Attalos and put him to death.
Then suddenly marching southwards, he suppressed by
skilful diplomacy the incipient rebellion of the Greek
states. In the next place he turned his arms northwards,
and, after much severe fighting, subjugated the barbarous
tribes which lay between the frontiers of his kingdom
and the Danube. Finally, he quelled in blood and
desolation the revolt of Thebes, which had been prompted
by a false rumour of his death. Having thus in a single
year made himself a more powerful monarch than his
father had ever been, he directed all his energies to
complete the arrangements for the Persian expedition.
The whole force which he collected for this purpose
amounted to little more than 30,000 foot and 4500
horse.</p>

<p>The empire which this comparatively insignificant
force was destined to attack and overthrow was the
greatest which the world had as yet seen, and had already
subsisted for two hundred years. It had been founded
by Cyrus the Great, and extended by his successors till
it embraced all Asia from the shores of the Aegean and
the Levant to the regions of the Jaxartes and the Indus.
It was divided by the great belt of desert, which stretches
almost continuously from the Persian Gulf to the Sea
of Aral, into two great sections which differed widely
both in their physical aspect and the character of their
inhabitants. The eastern tribes living amid mountains
and deserts were rude, but distinguished for their hardihood,
their love of independence, and their martial prowess.
The western Asiatics, on the other hand, who inhabited
those fair and fertile countries which had been the earliest
seats of civilisation, were singularly deficient in these
qualities. Enervated by ease and the affluence of luxuries,
they offered but a feeble resistance to Alexander, and
bent their necks submissively to his yoke. He had quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
a different experience when he came into conflict with
the tribes of the Oxus, Jaxartes, and Indus. They
resisted him with the utmost spirit and determination,
rose against him even after defeat, and succeeded in
inflicting a signal disaster on his arms.</p>

<p>The system by which the vast empire was governed
may be described as a rigid monarchy. It was divided
by Darius Hystaspes into twenty provinces, a number
which was afterwards much augmented probably by
the subdivision of the larger ones. The government of
each was committed to a satrap<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> whose powers were
almost despotic. He collected the revenues, from which,
besides defraying the expenses of his own administration,
he was obliged to remit a fixed amount of annual tribute
to the royal treasury. The Indian satrapy, which probably
included Baktria and was limited to the regions west
of the Indus, paid the largest tribute, which, as we learn
from Herodotos, amounted to the immense sum of 360
talents of gold dust.</p>

<p>The king who filled the throne at the time of the
invasion was Darius Kodomannos, who had some reputation
for personal courage and some other virtues which
might have adorned his reign had it been fated to be
peaceful. He was, however, like Louis XVI. of France,
quite destitute of the skill and nerve required for piloting
the vessel of the state in stormy times. The empire
long before his accession had been falling into decay.
Insurrections were for ever breaking out. Some of the
provinces, though nominally subject, were practically
independent, while in others the satraps both claimed
and exercised the right of transmitting their authority
by hereditary succession. What saved it from dissolution
was, not so much the strength of the government, as
the reluctance of the leading men, through their distrust
of each other’s good faith, to enter into combinations
against it. It was another symptom of its weakness,
that the king in his wars trusted far more to the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
troops in his pay than to his native levies and their
leaders. Neither the Greeks nor the Persians had lost
sight of the fact that at Kounaxa the victory had been
won for Cyrus by the Greek mercenaries.</p>

<p>Alexander having completed his preparations, and
appointed Antipater to act as regent of Macedonia
during his absence, crossed over the Hellespont into
Asia in the spring of 334 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> His army, though
numerically insignificant when compared with the magnitude
of the enterprise which lay before it, proved nevertheless,
from the physical superiority, courage, and daring
of the men, combined with the perfection of their organisation
and discipline, and the consummate skill of their
leader, more than a match for any force, however numerous,
which was brought into the field against it. We may
here quote a passage from Thirlwall, in which he describes
the composition, organisation, and equipment of this heroic
little army which performed the greatest deeds recorded
in military annals:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The main body, the phalanx—or quadruple phalanx, as it
was sometimes called, to mark that it was formed of four divisions,
each bearing the same name—presented a mass of 18,000
men, which was distributed, at least by Alexander, into six
brigades of 3000 each, formidable in its aspect, and on ground
suited to its operations, irresistible in its attacks. The phalangite
soldier wore the usual defensive armour of the Greek heavy
infantry—helmet, breast-plate, and greaves: and almost the whole
front of his person was covered with the long shield called the
<i>aspis</i>. His weapons were a sword long enough to enable a man
in the second rank to reach an enemy who had come to close
quarters with the comrade who stood before him, and the celebrated
spear, known by the Macedonian name, <i>sarissa</i>, four-and-twenty
feet long. The sarissa, when couched, projected eighteen
feet in front of the soldier: and the space between the ranks was
such that those of the second rank were fifteen, those of the
third twelve, those of the fourth nine, those of the fifth six, and
those of the sixth three feet in advance of the first line: so that
the man at the head of the file was guarded on each side by the
points of six spears. The ordinary depth of the phalanx was of
sixteen ranks. The men who stood too far behind to use their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
sarissas, and who therefore kept them raised until they advanced
to fill a vacant place, still added to the pressure of the mass. As
the efficacy of the phalanx depended on its compactness, and
this again on the uniformity of its movements, the greatest care
was taken to select the best soldiers for the foremost and hindmost
ranks—the frames, as it were, of the engine. The bulk
and core of the phalanx consisted of Macedonians; but it was
composed in part of foreign troops. These were no doubt
Greeks. But the northern Illyrians, Paeonians, Agrianians, and
Thracians, who were skilled in the use of missiles, furnished bowmen,
dartsmen, and slingers: probably according to the proportion
which the master of tactics deemed the most eligible, about
half the number of the phalanx. To these was added another
class of infantry, peculiar in some respects to the Macedonian
army, though the invention belonged to Iphicrates. They were
called Hypaspists, because, like the phalangites, they carried the
long shield: but their spears were shorter, their swords longer,
their armour lighter. They were thus prepared for more rapid
movements, and did not so much depend on the nature of the
ground. They formed a corps of about 6000 men. The cavalry
was similarly distinguished into three classes by its arms, accoutrements,
and mode of warfare. Its main strength consisted in
1500 Macedonian and as many Thessalian horse. But the rider
and his horse were cased in armour, and his weapons seem to
have corresponded to those of the heavy infantry. The light
cavalry, chiefly used for skirmishing and pursuit, and in part
armed with the sarissa, was drawn from the Thracians and
Paeonians, and was about the third of the number of the heavy
horse. A smaller body of Greek cavalry probably stood in
nearly the same relation to the other two divisions, as the
Hypaspists to the heavy and light infantry. To the Hypaspists
belonged the royal foot bodyguard, the Agêma, or royal escort,
and the Argyraspides, so called from the silver ornaments with
which their long shields were enriched. But the precise relation
in which these bodies stood to each other does not appear very
distinctly from the descriptions of the ancients. The royal horse-guard
was composed of eight Macedonian squadrons, filled with
the sons of the best families. The numbers of each are not
ascertained, but they seem in all not much to have exceeded or
fallen short of a thousand.”</p>

</div>

<p>From this description of the Macedonian army, it may
easily be imagined what a formidable aspect its main arm—the
phalanx of panoplied infantry—would present to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the enemy. Polybios informs us that the Roman officers
who were present in the battle of Kynoskephalai, and
then saw the phalanx for the first time, told him that in
all their experience of war they had never seen anything
so terrible. The phalanx, however, as that historian
points out, could only operate effectively on level and
open ground—was quite unfit for rapid advance and
rough terrain, and useless if its ranks were broken. It
was thus helpless in face of an active enemy unless well
supported by cavalry and light troops. This explains
why Alexander attached so much importance to his
cavalry. In point of fact he owed none of his victories
to the phalanx; his cavalry, rapid in its evolutions and
charging with resistless impetuosity, gained them all. In
addition to the troops which have been particularised in
the extract, there was one kind organised by Alexander
called <i>dimachai</i>, intermediate between cavalry and infantry,
being designed to fight on horseback or on foot as circumstances
required. His artillery formed a very useful part
of his equipment. The <i>balistai</i> and <i>katapeltai</i> of which it
consisted threw stones and darts to the distance of 300
yards, and was frequently employed with great effect.</p>

<p>As he foresaw that in the course of his expedition he
was likely to penetrate to regions either imperfectly or
altogether unknown, he entertained on his staff men of
literary and scientific requirements to write his deeds, and
describe those countries and nations to which he might
carry his arms.</p>

<p>He first came into conflict with the Persians on the
banks of the Granîkos, a small river, which, flowing from
Mount Ida through the Trojan plain, enters the Propontis
to the west of Kyzikos. Their army, which consisted of
20,000 horse, and an equal number of Greek mercenaries,
was commanded by several satraps who were assisted by
the counsels of Memnon the Rhodian, the ablest general
in the service of Darius. The Persians were drawn up in
line along the right bank of the stream, while their
mercenaries were posted on a range of heights that rose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
in the rear. Alexander drew up his forces on the opposite
bank in the order which he adopted in all his great
battles. Thus the phalanx formed his centre; he
commanded himself the extreme right, and the officer
in whom he had most confidence the extreme left. To
either wing were attached such brigades of the phalanx
as circumstances seemed to require. The Persians having
observed where Alexander was posted, strengthened their
left wing with dense squadrons of their best cavalry,
anticipating that this part of their line would be exposed
to the first fury of the onset led by himself in person.
They judged aright. Alexander having sent a detachment
of cavalry across the stream, followed with other
cavalry and a portion of the phalanx. The Persians
made a gallant resistance, but were soon beaten. Their
darts and scimitars were no match for the tough cornel
of the Macedonian spears. Their ranks first broke where
Alexander himself in the hottest of the fight was dealing
death and wounds around him. A blow which was
descending on his own head, and which if delivered would
have proved fatal, was intercepted by Kleitos, who cut off
the arm of the assailant, scimitar and all. The field was
won before either the phalanx on the one side, or the
Greek mercenaries on the other, could come into action.
The Macedonians, after returning from a short pursuit,
closed around the mercenaries and cut them down, all but
2000 who were made prisoners and sent in chains to
Macedonia. The number of the Persians slain was about
1000 against only 115 on the other side.</p>

<p>Alexander did not, like most other conquerors after a
victory, plunder the surrounding country, but regarding
Asia as already his own, treated the inhabitants as subjects
whose interests he was bound to protect and promote.
Neither did he at once advance into the interior, but,
acting by a rule of strategy which he was always careful
to observe, resolved to make his rear secure. He therefore
first reduced all the western provinces of the empire
which Darius after the defeat of his satraps had placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
under the supreme authority of Memnon the Rhodian.
Memnon was a formidable antagonist, both from his skill
in war, and from his having a powerful fleet at his
command, which gave him the dominion of the sea, and
enabled him to threaten at will the shores of Greece and
Macedonia.</p>

<p>Alexander marched from the battle-field to Ilion, and
advanced thence southward through the beautiful regions
of Ionia and the other maritime states, which, in striking
contrast to their present blighted condition, were then at
the height of prosperity—adorned with numerous rich
and splendid cities, which vied with each other in all the
arts of refinement. The terror of his name preceded him,
and these cities one after another, including even Sardis,
the western capital, which was strongly fortified, threw
open their gates to admit him. Milêtos, however, and
Halikarnassos, being supported by the Persian fleet,
refused to surrender, and did not fall into his hands until
each had been for some time besieged. After the fall of
Halikarnassos, the rest of Karia, of which it was the
capital, submitted, and then the operations of the first
year of the war were brought to a close by the reduction
of all Lykia. In this province he gave his army some
rest.</p>

<p>The next campaign opened with the conquest of
Pamphylia, after which Alexander turned his march away
from the coast with a view to invade Phrygia, which lay
to the north beyond the lofty range of Tauros. It was
now the depth of winter, but Alexander in defiance of all
obstacles—frost and snow, torrents and precipices, and the
resistance of the fierce Pisidian mountaineers—forced his
way into the Phrygian plains. This passage of the Tauros
at such a season was an achievement not unworthy to
rank with the more celebrated passage of the Alps made
by Hannibal about a century later. After he had cleared
the defiles, a march of five days brought him to Kelainai,
the capital of the greater Phrygia, which was pleasantly
situated where the river Marsyas joins the Maeander, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
was embellished with a palace and a royal park. Alexander,
deeming its acropolis to be impregnable, made
terms with the inhabitants, and then advanced to the
ancient capital called Gordion, after Gordios, the father
of the celebrated Midas, the first king of the country.
Here was the complicated knot to which the prophecy
was attached that whoever untied it should be Lord of
Asia. It was tied on a rope of bark which fastened the
yoke to the pole of the wagon on which Midas had been
carried into the city on the day when the people chose
him as their king. Alexander either undid the knot or
cut it through with his sword.</p>

<p>On the return of spring he moved forward to Ankyra
(now Angora), and there had the satisfaction to receive
the submission of the Paphlagonians, who at that time
were a very powerful nation. Being thus free to move
southwards without leaving an enemy in his rear, he
entered Kappadokia, and having overrun it without
encountering any serious opposition, he recrossed the
Tauros by a pass that admitted him into the fertile plains
of Eastern Kilikia. The capital of this province was
Tarsos, a flourishing seat of commerce, art, and learning,
built on both banks of the river Kydnos, which was
navigable to the sea. This important city fell without
resistance into Alexander’s hands, the satrap having fled
at the tidings of his approach. Here, however, he nearly
lost his life, having caught a violent fever by throwing
himself when heated into the waters of the Kydnos,
which ran cold with the snows of Mount Tauros. After
his recovery he sent Parmeniôn eastward to occupy the
passes leading into Syria, called the Syrian Gates, and
marched himself in the opposite direction to reduce the
hill-tribes of Western Kilikia. In the meantime Darius,
advancing from the East, had crossed the Euphrates and the
Syrian desert at the head of an army not less numerous
than that with which Napoleon invaded Russia, and was
lying encamped on a wide plain suitable for his cavalry
within a two days’ march of the Syrian Gates. Here he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
waited for some time ready to fall upon the Macedonian
troops and crush them with the overwhelming superiority
of his numbers when they debouched from the defile.
When he despaired of their coming, he marched into
Kilikia through a pass known as the Amanian Gates and
encamped on the banks of the Pinaros which flows
through the plain of Issos to the sea. He thus placed
himself in a trap where he was hemmed in by the mountains
and the sea in a narrow plain not more than a mile
and a half in width. Alexander meanwhile had passed
through the other gates into the Syrian plain when he
learned to his astonishment that Darius was now in his
rear. He at once retraced his steps, and by midnight
regained the pass, where from one of its summits he
beheld the Persian watchfires gleaming far and wide over
the plain of Issos. At daybreak he marched down the
pass, and on reaching the open part of the plain made the
usual disposition of his forces, Parmeniôn commanding the
left, and himself the right wing. Darius had drawn up
his line, which extended from the mountains to the sea,
along the northern bank of the river Pinaros. In the
centre, which confronted the dreaded Macedonian phalanx,
he had posted a body of 30,000 heavy-armed Greek
mercenaries.</p>

<p>Alexander began the action by dislodging a detachment
of the enemy which had been posted at the base of
the mountains and threatened his rear. Finding the
Persians did not advance, he crossed the river and charged
their left wing with such impetuosity that he broke their
ranks and swept them from the field irretrievably discomfited.
He then wheeled round and brought timely
succour to his phalanx, which the Greek mercenaries of
Darius were driving back with disordered ranks to the
river. The struggle now became desperate, for these
mercenaries, bitterly resenting the state of political degradation
to which the Macedonians had reduced their
compatriots in southern Greece, now fought against them
with all the fury that the passions of hate and rivalry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
could inspire. They were nevertheless driven back, and
the tide of battle surged up towards the state chariot
itself, on which Darius was mounted in the centre of his
line. The pusillanimous monarch no sooner perceived
that his person was in danger than he ordered his
charioteer to turn the heads of his horses for flight.
This decided the fortunes of the day; it was the signal
of his defeat, and his troops, on seeing it, at once broke
from their ranks and fled from the field. The cavalry
even, which on the extreme right had victory almost
within their grasp, yielded to the general panic, and
helped to swell the crowd of fugitives. As the narrowness
of the plain allowed but very little room for escape,
the vanquished were massacred in myriads. Darius
escaped across the Euphrates, but his treasures and his
family, consisting of his mother, wife, and children, fell
into Alexander’s hands, who treated these illustrious
captives with all the kindness and courtesy which were
due alike to their misfortunes and their exalted rank.</p>

<p>He did not pursue Darius, and about two years passed
away before he again met him in battle. His victory had
left Syria and Egypt open to his arms, and these countries
had to be reduced and the power of Persia effectually
crushed at sea before he could advance with safety into
the heart of the empire. He therefore marched southward
to Phoenicia, the seaports of which supplied the Persians
with most of their war-galleys. Parmeniôn he sent forward
with a small detachment to seize Damascus, where Darius,
before his defeat, had deposited his treasures. The city
surrendered without resistance, and a vast and varied
spoil fell into the hands of the Macedonians. The cities
along the Syrian coast submitted in like manner to Alexander
himself, all but Tyre, which sent him a golden
crown, but refused to admit him within her gates. For
this temerity the city of merchant princes paid a dreadful
penalty. Alexander, having captured it after a seven
months’ siege, burned it to the ground, and most of the
inhabitants he either slew or sold into slavery. This is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
considered to have been the greatest of all Alexander’s
military achievements. Tyre had hitherto been deemed
impregnable. It was built on an island separated from
the mainland by a channel of the sea half a mile in width;
its walls, which were of great solidity, rose to an immense
height, and its navy gave it the command of the sea.
The inhabitants, moreover, were expert in arms, and
defended themselves with such spirit and obstinacy that
Alexander found himself unable to overcome their resistance,
until he obtained from Cyprus and Sidon a fleet
superior to their own. He had also to construct a causeway
through the channel to enable him to bring his
engines close up to the walls, and this was a work of
vast labour and difficulty. His merciless treatment of
the vanquished darkly overshadows the glory of this
memorable exploit.</p>

<p>Palestine, with the adjoining districts, next submitted
to the Conqueror. Gaza alone, like Tyre, closed its gates
against him. This city, which stood not far from the sea,
towards the edge of the desert which separates Syria from
Egypt, was strongly fortified, and held out for two months.
Alexander took it by storm, slaughtered the garrison, and
then set out for Egypt. A seven days’ march through
the desert brought him to Pelusium. The Egyptians,
who smarted under the bondage of Persia, like the
Israelites of old under their own, hailed his advent as
that of a deliverer, and gladly submitted to his rule.</p>

<p>Alexander proceeded as far southward as Memphis
and the Pyramids, and then embarking on the western or
Kanopic branch of the Nile, sailed down to Lake Mareôtis,
and landed on the narrow sandy isthmus by which that
lake is separated from the sea. This neck of land was
faced on the north by the island of Pharos, a long ridge
of rock which sheltered it from all the violence of the
ocean. Alexander, discerning with his keen eye all the
advantages of such a position for commerce, at once
founded on the isthmus the city of Alexandria, which,
as he anticipated, soon became the great centre of trade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
between the eastern and western worlds. His next object
was to consult the oracle of Jupiter Ammon, which was
said to have been visited by Heraklês and Perseus, from
both of whom he claimed to be descended. He therefore
marched along the coast for about 200 miles to Paraitonion,
which lay at the western extremity of Egypt. On the
way he was met by deputies from Kyrênê, who brought
him valuable presents, and invited him to visit their city.
From Paraitonion he marched southward through the
Libyan desert, and, after some days, reached the large
and beautiful oasis where, embosomed amid thick woods,
rose the temple of Ammon and the palace of his priests.
On consulting the oracle he obtained answers, about the
nature of which he stated nothing further than that they
were satisfactory. He then returned across the desert to
Memphis, where he settled the future government of Egypt,
and ordered justice to be dispensed according to the ancient
laws of the country. From Memphis he directed his
march to Syria, and on reaching Tyre, remained there for
some time. While he was in Egypt he had been visited
by Hegelochos, his admiral, who reported that the Persians
had been dispossessed of the islands which they had acquired
in the Aegean; that their fleet had been dissipated,
and that all their leaders were prisoners except Pharnabazos,
the successor of Memnon, who had died somewhat
suddenly while Alexander was in Phrygia.</p>

<p>Alexander was now, therefore, the undisputed master
of all the countries west of the Euphrates, and could with
complete security turn his arms eastward to bring his contest
with Persia to a final issue. Darius, on the other hand,
who, in the interval between his defeat and the fall of Tyre,
had twice sent an embassy to the Conqueror to sue for
peace and the ransom of his family, on terms which,
though most tempting, had been haughtily refused, was
mustering all his forces to encounter the storm of war
which would sooner or later burst from the clouds that
hung ominously on his western horizon. The army he
now raised was far stronger numerically than that with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
which he had fought at Issos, and, as it was drawn chiefly
from the east, consisted of the best troops in his empire.
He led it from Babylon across the Tigris, and marching
northward along the eastern bank of that river, reached
the plains of northern Assyria, which afforded ample
space for the evolutions of his numerous cavalry. Here
he encamped on a wide plain between the Tigris and the
mountains of Kurdistan, near a village called Gaugamela.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.—Seal of Darius.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Alexander, having remained at Tyre until his preparations
were completed, started from that city after midsummer
in the year 331 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> On crossing the Euphrates at the
fords of Thapsakos, he learned where Darius was, and at
once accelerated his march to find him. He passed the
Tigris, which had been left unguarded, and advancing
southward for a few days, came in sight of the Persian
host, which he found already drawn up in line prepared
for action. It is said that Parmeniôn, alarmed by the
immense array of the hostile ranks, came at a late hour
to the king’s tent and proposed a night attack, and that
Alexander’s answer was that it would be a base thing
to steal a victory. His forces amounted only to 40,000
infantry and 7000 horse, yet he was so confident of
success that on the morning of the decisive day his sleep
was deeper and longer than usual.</p>

<p>In its main features, the battle that followed was
but a repetition of the day of Issos. Alexander again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
commanded the right wing and Parmeniôn the left. Again
Darius posted himself in the centre of his line, and again
the Greek mercenaries confronted the Macedonian phalanx.
Again Alexander, at the head of the Companion cavalry,
made havoc of the troops which guarded the royal standard;
and again Darius, terror-struck at his near approach,
ignominiously fled from the field. His flight gave once
more the signal of defeat, and that too, as at Issos, just
at the time when his cavalry on the right had made the
position of Parmeniôn most critical.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Alexander was recalled
from the pursuit of Darius, whom he was eagerly
bent on capturing, by a messenger sent by Parmeniôn
pressing for instant aid. He at once turned back. On
his way he met the Persian and Parthian cavalry and the
Indian troops now in full retreat. A combat close and
hot followed. The fugitives were for the most part
killed, but sold their lives dearly. On returning to the
field Alexander found that his left wing was no longer
in distress, but putting the enemy to rout, and he therefore
started once more in pursuit of Darius. The fugitive
escaped, however, to Ekbatana, the capital in former
days of the Median kings.</p>

<p>Accounts differ as to the numbers that were killed in
this battle. Arrian says, absurdly enough, that 300,000
of the Persians were slain, and a greater number taken
prisoners. Diodôros reduces the amount to 90,000, and
Curtius to 40,000. The loss again on Alexander’s side
is reckoned by Arrian at 100, by Curtius at 300, and by
Diodôros at 500.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>Alexander pursued the fugitive troops as far as Arbêla—the
place which has given its name to the battle, though
it was sixty miles distant from the field whereon it was
fought. Here he found the baggage of Darius, and having
enriched himself with its spoils, he advanced southward to
Babylon. This great capital, which once gave law to all
the nations of the East, had under the rule of the Achaimenids
gradually declined both in wealth and importance.
Its inhabitants, like the Egyptians, detested their Persian
masters, who oppressed them and persecuted their religion.
They issued therefore from their gates in a joyful procession
to welcome the victor and present him with gifts. His
first acts on entering the city were well calculated to make
a favourable impression on their minds. He ordered the
temple of Belus to be rebuilt, honoured that deity with a
public sacrifice according to the Chaldaean ritual, and restored
to his priests the immense revenues with which
they had been endowed by the Assyrian kings.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Alexander thus found himself the master of a more
spacious empire than any the world had yet seen. No
king or conqueror had ever before stood on such a giddy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
pinnacle of power. As he had made his way to this
supreme height before he had yet reached those years
or experienced those vicissitudes of fortune which have a
sobering effect on the mind, it is not surprising that, as in
the case of Napoleon, whose genius was at many points in
close touch with his own, and who, at a like early age, had
amazed the world with his deeds of arms, unbounded
success tended to deteriorate his character. He is found
henceforth becoming more arrogant and despotic, more
suspicious, and avid of flattery, while less tolerant of advice
or remonstrance, and less capable of controlling the
violence of his passions. The simple style of living in
which he had been brought up seemed no longer to
please him, and he began to assume all the pomp and
splendour with which an oriental despot loves to surround
himself,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> an innovation in his habits which deeply
mortified the pride of the Macedonians. It may be urged
in his defence that he may have made the change less
from any real inclination than from the politic motive
of conciliating his new subjects by conforming to their
tastes and habits.</p>

<p>Before leaving Babylon he settled the affairs of Assyria
and its dependencies in accordance with a principle on
which he generally acted, committing the civil administration
to a native ruler, but leaving the command of the
forces and the collection of the revenue in the hands
of Macedonian officers. He then marched eastward,
and in twenty days reached Sousa, the favourite capital
of the Persian kings. Rich as Babylon was, its treasures
were as nothing compared with those which had been
here accumulated. The sums contained in the treasury
amounted to 40,000 talents of uncoined gold and silver,
and 9000 talents of coined gold, and there was other
booty besides of immense value, including the spoils
which Xerxes had carried off from Greece—the recovery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
of which gratified beyond measure the patriotic feelings
of the army.</p>

<p>From Sousa Alexander took the road to Persepolis,
the ancient capital of the Persians, a rich and splendid
city lying to the south-east of Sousa, in the beautiful vale
of Persis which was fertilised by the streams descending
from Mount Zagros, the Mêdos, and the Araxês.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> On his
route he passed through the hill-country of the Ouxians,
which like that of the Pisidians, was occupied by warlike
and predatory tribes. These mountaineers were nominally
subject to Persia, but they nevertheless at one of their
defiles exacted toll even from the Great King himself
whenever he passed through their country in going
between his two capitals. They beset this defile with
the whole of their effective force to levy the customary
tribute from Alexander, who payed them what he called
their dues in the form of a crushing defeat.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He then
plundered their villages, and, having received their submission,
pressed forward by way of the formidable pass
called the Persian Gates.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Here the satrap Ariobarzanes,
at the head of more than 40,000 men, tried but in vain
to arrest his progress. Alexander, with his usual skill
and courage forced the position, and meeting with no
further resistance reached Persepolis, where no defence
was attempted. He not only permitted his soldiers to
plunder this ancient capital, but, if we may believe
the story, with which Dryden’s Ode has made us familiar,
set fire with his own hands in a drunken revel to the
royal palace, a structure of supreme magnificence, as
its ruins, which are still to be seen, attest. It is more
probable, however, that he burned it from motives of
policy, partly to show the Persians how absolutely he
was now their master, and partly to avenge Greece for
the destruction of her temples by Xerxes. In the
royal treasury he found the vast sum of 120,000 talents,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
which falls little short of thirty million pounds of our
money. As it was now mid-winter he here gave his
army some respite from their toils. He gave himself,
however, no rest, but led a detachment to Pasargadai,
the primitive seat of the Achaimenids, which contained an
august monument, the tomb of Cyrus, which still exists,
and a rich treasury which he plundered.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> He next
assailed the Mardians, and marching over ice and snow,
reduced their mountain fastnesses and compelled their
submission.</p>

<p>In the spring of 330 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> he resumed the pursuit of
Darius, who was still at Ekbatana making vain efforts
to raise another army. The fallen monarch, on hearing
that the enemy was again moving against him and had
reached Media, fled eastward hoping to find protection
and safety in the far remote province of Baktria, of
which his kinsman Bessos was the satrap. The capital
which he had left was the summer residence of the
Persian kings, and was noted for the enormous strength
of its citadel. Alexander therefore ordered Parmeniôn
to transport thither, as to a place of peculiar security,
the treasures which had been seized at the other capitals,
and to confide their custody to a strong guard of Macedonian
soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> This done, he set out with a light
detachment of troops in the hope of overtaking the
fugitive king before he passed through the Kaspian
Gates. At Rhagai, which was a day’s rapid march from
that pass, he learned that Darius had escaped beyond it,
and he therefore halted for five days to recruit his
troops. On renewing the pursuit and reaching the open
country beyond the gates, he learned that the Persian
officers who were escorting their sovereign had conspired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
against him and deprived him of his liberty. Greatly
fearing now lest the traitors had some deadlier purpose
in view, he made incredible exertions to overtake them,
and he came up with them on the fourth day—but all
too late. The conspirators, among whom was Bessos,
finding that the pursuit was gaining upon them, mortally
wounded the hapless king, who breathed his last before
Alexander reached him. “Such,” says Arrian, “was the
end of Darius, who as a warrior was singularly remiss and
injudicious. In other respects his character is blameless,
either because he was just by nature, or because he had
no opportunity of displaying the contrary, as his accession
and the Macedonian invasion were simultaneous. It was
not in his power, therefore, to oppress his subjects, as his
danger was greater than theirs. His reign was one unbroken
series of disasters, and he was at last treacherously
assassinated by his most intimate connections. At his death
he was about fifty years old.” Alexander sent his body
into Persia with orders that it should be buried with all
due honours in the royal sepulchre. Bessos escaped into
his own satrapy where he assumed the upright tiara, the
distinguishing emblem of Persian royalty, and took the
name of Artaxerxes.</p>

<p>Alexander now halted at Hekatompylos,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> a place
which received this Greek name from its being the centre
where many roads met, and which became in after times
the capital of the Parthian kings. Being joined here by
the rest of his army, he prepared to invade Hyrkania, from
which he was separated by the chain of mountains now
called the Elburz. As the passes were beset by robber-tribes,
he divided his army into three bodies. The most
numerous division crossed the mountains under his own
command by the shortest and most difficult roads.
Krateros made a circuit to the left through the country
of the Tapeirians (Taburistan), while the third division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
under Erigyios took the royal road which led westward
from Hekatompylos to Zadrakarta.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The divisions on
emerging from the defiles united, and encamped near
the last named place, which was the Hyrkanian capital.
Hither came to Alexander with three of his sons the
aged Artabazos, accompanied by the Tapeirian satrap
and by deputies from the Greek mercenaries of Darius.
Artabazos was received with distinguished honour, both
because of his high rank and the fidelity he had shown
to Darius, whom he had accompanied in his flight. The
satrap was confirmed in his government, but the deputies
were sternly told that as the mercenaries had violated the
duty which they owed to their country, they must submit
themselves unreservedly to the judgment of the king.
Alexander then attacked the Mardians who inhabited the
lofty mountains to the north-west of the Kaspian Gates.
They submitted after a slight resistance, and were ordered
to obey the Tapeirian satrap.</p>

<p>Alexander’s next object was to crush Bessos and
possess himself of all the eastern provinces as far as the
borders of India. He therefore marched eastward towards
Baktria, and having traversed the northern part of Parthia,
reached Sousia, a city of Areia (now Sous, near Meshed,
the present capital of Khorasan). Satibarzanes, the satrap
of that province, and one of the conspirators against
Darius, met him here, and having tendered his submission,
was confirmed in his government, and dismissed with an
escort of Macedonian horsemen to his capital, Artakoana.
Alexander then resumed his march towards Baktria, but
was arrested on the way by receiving word that Satibarzanes
had revolted in favour of Bessos, armed the Areians,
and slain his Macedonian escort. He therefore at once
altered his route, and by the promptitude of his appearance
confounded the plans of the satrap, who fled and was
deserted by most of his troops. Artakoana was captured
by Krateros after a short siege. This city stood in a
plain of exceptional fertility at a point where all the roads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
from the north to the south, and from the west to the
east, united, and Alexander, discerning the incomparable
advantages of its position, whether for war or commerce,
founded in its neighbourhood a new city in which he
planted a Macedonian colony. He called it Alexandreia,
and as it still exists as Herat, it will be seen how well
grounded was its founder’s belief in the strategetical and
commercial importance of its site.</p>

<p>Alexander, after suppressing this revolt, instead of
resuming his march to Baktria, moved forward to Prophthasia
(now Furrah), the capital of Drangiana (Seistan), of
which Barsaentes, another of the accomplices in the murder
of Darius, was satrap. This traitor was seized and executed.
Here an event occurred which has left a dark
stain on the character of Alexander. He was led to
suspect that a conspiracy had been formed against his life
by some of his principal officers, and among others by
the son of Parmeniôn, Philôtas, who held the most coveted
post in the army, that of commander of the Companion
Cavalry. It is certain that he was not an accomplice in
the plot; but as he had been informed of its existence,
and failed to give the king any warning of his danger, he
was accused before the Macedonian army and condemned
to death. He confessed under torture that his father,
Parmeniôn, had formed a design against the king’s life, and
that he had himself joined the recent plot, lest his father,
who was now an old man, might, before the plot was ripe,
be snatched away by death from his command at Ekbatana,
which placed the vast treasures deposited there at
his disposal. This confession, wrung by torture when its
agonies became insupportable, and obviously framed to
meet the wishes of the questioners, was no proof of the
guilt either of the father or the son. Parmeniôn was, nevertheless,
on this worthless evidence condemned to death,
and Alexander, whom he had so faithfully served, took
care that the sentence should be executed before the news
of his son’s death, which he might seek to avenge, could
reach his ears. Many other Macedonians were also at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
this time tried and put to death. Alexander’s confidence
in his friends was thus much shaken; and instead of
entrusting as formerly the command of the Companion
Cavalry to one individual, he divided that body into two
regiments, giving the command of one to Kleitos, and of
the other to Hêphaistiôn.</p>

<p>From Prophthasia he proceeded southwards into the
fertile plains along the Etymander (R. Helmund), then
inhabited by a peaceful tribe called the Ariaspians, who
had received from Cyrus the title of <i>Euergetai</i>—that is,
benefactors, because they had assisted him at a time when
he had been reduced to great straits. Alexander spent
two months in their dominions, probably awaiting the
arrival of reinforcements from Ekbatana. During this
interval Dêmetrios, a member of the king’s bodyguard,
was arrested on suspicion of his having been implicated
with Philôtas in the recent plot, and his office was bestowed
on Ptolemy, the son of Lagos, for whom this promotion
opened the way to a royal destiny. Alexander before
resuming his march appointed a governor over the Euergetai,
but rewarded their hospitality by augmenting their
territory and confirming them in the enjoyment of their
political privileges.</p>

<p>He left this country about mid-winter, and ascending
the valley of the Etymander penetrated into Arachosia, a
province which stretched eastward to the Indus. As he
advanced northward by Kandahar the snow lay deep on
the ground, and the soldiers suffered severely both from
hunger and cold. About this time he heard that the
Areians had again revolted at the instigation of Satibarzanes,
who had entered their province at the head of 2000
horse, and he immediately sent a detachment under Erigyios
to quell the insurgents. Continuing meanwhile his
own advance, he arrived at the foot of the colossal
mountain-barrier, the chain of Paropanisos, which separates
Kabul from Baktria. Here in a commanding position,
near the village of Charikar, which stands in the rich and
beautiful valley of Koh-Daman, he founded yet another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Alexandreia (called by way of distinction Alexandreia of
the Paropamisadai, or Alexandria apud Caucasum), and
planted it with Macedonian colonists. According to
Strabo he wintered in this neighbourhood, but Arrian leads
us to suppose that he departed as soon as he had founded
the city. He crossed the mountains, as some think, by
the Bamiân Pass, the most western of the four routes
which give access from the Koh-Daman to the regions of
the Upper Oxus. It is likelier, however, that he ascended
by the more direct route along the course of the Panjshir
river. The army again suffered on the way from the
severity of the cold, and still more from the scarcity of
provisions. According to Aristoboulos nothing grew on
these hills but terebinth trees and the herb called silphium,
on which the flocks and herds of the mountaineers pastured.
This march, which terminated at Adrapsa, occupied fifteen
days.</p>

<p>The Macedonians had now reached a fertile country;
but as Bessos had ordered it to be ravaged, they found a
wide barrier of desolation opposed to their further advance.
The barrier was interposed in vain. Alexander resolutely
pressed forward, and Bessos and his associates fled at his
approach, and, crossing the Oxus, retired into Sogdiana.
Aornos and Baktra, the two principal cities of the Baktrian
satrapy, surrendered without resistance, and the satrapy
itself was soon afterwards reduced. At Baktra Erigyios,
who had succeeded in quelling the Areian revolt, rejoined
the army. Alexander having appointed Artabazos satrap
of his new conquest, marched to the Oxus in pursuit of
Bessos, and came upon that river at the point where Kijil
now stands. There it was about three-quarters of a mile
in breadth, and the current was found to be both deep
and rapid. The passage, which occupied five days, was
made on floats, supported by skins stuffed with straw, and
rendered watertight. The army had no sooner gained
the right bank than messengers arrived from two of the
leading adherents of Bessos—Spitamenes, the satrap
of Sogdiana, and Dataphernes—promising to surrender<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Bessos, who was already their prisoner, if Alexander
would send a small force to their support. The king
assented, and sent Ptolemy forward to receive the traitor
from their hands. They gave him up, and he was
conducted with a rope round his neck into the presence
of the king, who ordered him to be scourged and then
conveyed to Zariaspa (which some identify with Baktra),
there to await his final doom.</p>

<p>The army next marched forward to Marakanda, now
Samarkand, then merely the capital of the Sogdian
satrapy, but destined to be in aftertimes the capital
of the vast empire founded by Timour. It stood in the
valley of the Polytimêtos (R. Kohik), a region of such
exuberant fertility and beauty that it figures in Persian
poetry as one of the four paradises of the world. Alexander
remained for some time in this pleasant neighbourhood
to remount his cavalry and otherwise recruit his
forces. He then advanced to the river Jaxartes, which
formed the boundary between the Persian empire and
the barbarous Skythian tribes, and which the Greeks
confounded with the Tanais or Don. The country was
protected against the inroads of these warlike tribes by a
line of fortified towns, of which the largest and strongest,
Cyropolis, had been founded, as its name imports, by
Cyrus. Alexander captured all these fortresses and
manned them with small Macedonian garrisons; and to
curb the Skythians still more effectually, founded on the
banks of the Jaxartes, near where Khojent now stands,
still another Alexandreia, which the Greeks for distinction’s
sake called <i>Eschatê</i>, or “the Extreme.” In the midst of
this undertaking, he was interrupted by the sudden outbreak
of a widespread rebellion instigated by Spitamenes
and his confederates. Taking immediate and energetic
steps for its suppression, he in a few days recovered the
seven towns; and then crossing the Jaxartes, defeated the
Skythians, who with a view to aid the insurgents had mustered
in great force on its right bank. After this victory
he received tidings of the first serious disaster that had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
befallen his arms. He had sent a large force to operate
against Spitamenes, who was at the time besieging the
Macedonian garrison which held Marakanda. On learning
that this force was approaching, the rebel chief retired
down the Polytimêtos to Bokhara, and thence to the vast
desert which stretches from Sogd to the Sea of Aral.
Here he was joined by a large body of Skythian horsemen,
and thus reinforced turned upon his pursuers, drove
them back from the edge of the desert, which they had
just entered, into the valley whence they had emerged,
and there, amid the woody ravines of the Polytimetos, cut
them to pieces almost to a man. Encouraged by this
success, he returned to Marakanda and renewed the siege
of its citadel, but on learning that Alexander was rapidly
returning from the Jaxartes, he retraced his steps towards
the desert, and reached it before the enemy overtook him.
The course of the pursuit led Alexander to the scene of
the late disaster. His first care was to bury the slain,
and he then avenged their death by ravaging with fire
and sword, in all its length and breadth, the lovely valley
of the Polytimetos. He showed no mercy, but slaughtered
all who fell into his hands, soldier and citizen alike. This
is certainly, as Thirlwall remarks, one of the acts of his
life for which it is most difficult to find an excuse.</p>

<p>As the year (329 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) was now drawing to a close, he
recrossed the Oxus and returned to Zariaspa (Baktra?),
where he spent the winter. Sentence was here pronounced
upon Bessos, who was mutilated and then sent
to Ekbatana for execution. Alexander’s European forces,
as the narrative has shown, were constantly undergoing
diminution, not only by losses in the field, but also by his
leaving Macedonian veterans to garrison important strongholds,
or to form the nucleus of the population of the
cities he founded. He therefore from time to time sent
requisitions for recruits to Macedonia and Greece, and as
these were adequately met the fighting quality of his
troops was always maintained at the same high level.
During his stay at Baktra a great number of such recruits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
arrived, and filled up the large gap which the late disaster
had made in his ranks. There came thither also ambassadors
from the King of the Skythians, bringing presents
and the offer of a marriage alliance, which was declined.
The King of the Khorasmians, moreover, whose dominions,
according to his own account, bordered on the land of the
Kolchians and the Amazons, came in person and offered
his services to Alexander should he wish to subdue the
nations to the north and west of the Kaspian Sea.
Alexander, however, being now anxious to enter India,
declined his offers for the present.</p>

<p>The accounts of his next two campaigns are confused,
and not always mutually consistent. According to
Curtius, when he moved from Zariaspa, he crossed the
river Ochos (now the Aksou), and came to a city called
Marginia, probably the <i>Marginan</i> of our times. Arrian,
however, makes no mention of this expedition. The
Baktrians were still imperfectly subjugated, and the
Sogdians, notwithstanding the severe chastisement they
had received, were again up in arms against his authority.
He therefore left Krateros to deal with the former, while
he marched in person against Marakanda. On his way
thither he performed another of his marvellous achievements,
the capture of a fortress perched on the summit of
a steep, lofty, and strongly fortified rock, held by a powerful
garrison, and deemed to be impregnable. He captured
it, nevertheless. Within this stronghold Oxyartes, a
Baktrian chief, had for safety deposited his wife and
daughters. Roxana, the eldest daughter, was, next to
the wife of Darius, the most beautiful of all Asiatic
women, and Alexander was so captivated with her charms
that he did not hesitate to make her his wife.</p>

<p>Spitamenes, meanwhile, assisted by the Massagetai,
one of the Skythian tribes that ranged over the Khorasmian
desert, made a devastating irruption into Baktria,
and though he was in the end repulsed by Krateros,
escaped into the desert beyond the reach of pursuit.
Fearing he might renew his attack in some other quarter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Alexander hastened to Marakanda to settle the province
and provide for its security against future hostile incursions.
To this end he directed a number of new towns
to be founded and planted with Macedonian, Greek, and
native colonists. In the course of this expedition he
came to the Royal Park at Bazaria (perhaps Bokhara),
and while hunting within its precincts killed a lion of
extraordinary size with his own hand.</p>

<p>On his return to Marakanda a tragic incident occurred—his
murder of Kleitos, from whom he had received
some provocation in the course of a drunken revel. As
he was tenderly attached to Kleitos, who was the brother
of his nurse, and had saved his life at the Granîkos, his
remorse for this frenzied deed knew no bounds at the
time, and gave him many bitter moments in his after life.</p>

<p>His next expedition led him towards the western
frontier of the province, where he reduced the district
called Xenippa, which lay on the skirts of the Noura
mountains—a range that runs from east to west about
ten miles north of Bokhara. As Spitamenes was supposed
to be in the desert not far off, he left Koinos in
that part of the country with orders to capture that
audacious rebel, while he himself withdrew to Nautaka,
where he intended to pass the winter. This place was
situated in a fertile oasis between Samarkand and the
Oxus, and must have occupied the site of Kurshee or
Kesh, noted afterwards as the birthplace of Timour.
Spitamenes, meanwhile, attacked Koinos, but was defeated
after a severe struggle, and driven back into the
desert. His Skythian confederates, fearing their own
country might be invaded, cut off his head and sent it to
Alexander; and so perished the most active, bold, and
persevering antagonist that he had as yet encountered in
Asia, one of the few who resolutely and to the last scorned
to bend his neck to a foreign yoke.</p>

<p>With the first return of spring (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 327) he moved
from his winter quarters to invade the Paraitakai, who, as
their name indicates, inhabited a mountainous district, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
were, some think, a branch of the widespread Takka tribe,
the name of which appears in Taxila, which designated a
great capital it possessed in India. In the country of the
Paraitakai, which lay to the east of Baktria and Sogdiana,
there was another great rock fortress, which, like the
Sogdian, was deemed impregnable. It was the main
stronghold of a chief called Khorienês, who, after holding
out for some time, was persuaded by Oxyartes to cast
himself on the generosity of the great conqueror, a quality
of which he had himself a very satisfactory experience.
Khoriênes therefore surrendered, and was rewarded by
being confirmed in his government. Alexander after this
success proceeded to Baktra in order to make preparation
for his expedition into India, but left Krateros to reduce
such of the tribes as still held out for independence. At
Baktra another tragedy was enacted. The court pages, at
the instigation of one of their number, called Hermolaos,
who had been subjected to some degrading punishment,
conspired against the king, who narrowly escaped assassination.
The pages, who all belonged to families of high
rank, were tortured to extract confessions of their guilt,
and were then stoned to death by the Macedonians. The
confessions indicated, it is said, that Kallisthenes, a literary
man attached to the court who had been permitted, on the
recommendation of his kinsman Aristotle, to accompany
the expedition, not only knew of the existence of the
plot, but had encouraged the pages to persist in their
design. He had rendered himself obnoxious to the king
by the freedom with which he expressed his opinions and
by his opposition to the Persian fashions introduced into
the court, and his doom was sealed. Accounts differ as
to the time and mode of his death. According to Ptolemy
he was tortured and then crucified, but Aristoboulos and
Chares agree in stating that he was carried about in chains
and died at last of disease in India.</p>

<p>The summer had set in when Alexander set out from
Baktra on his Indian expedition. He crossed the chain
of Paropamisos in ten days, and halted at the Alexandreia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
which he had founded at their base to settle the affairs of
that city and the surrounding district. The narrative of
his campaigns, from the time he left this place till he led
his army into Karmania, after its disastrous march through
the burning sands of the Gedrosian desert, is given in full
detail in the translations which form the body of this
work. His march, which on his emerging from the desert
lay through the beautiful and fertile province of Karmania,
resembled a festive procession, and the licence in which
he permitted his soldiers to indulge was meant no less to
obliterate the memory of their terrible sufferings in the
desert than to celebrate according to Bacchic fashion and
example the conquest of India.</p>

<p>In Karmania, Alexander received intelligence that
Philip, who had been left in command of all the country
west of the Indus had been slain in a mutiny by the Greek
mercenaries under his command, but that the Macedonian
troops had quelled the mutiny and put the assassins to
death. He did not at the time appoint any successor to
Philip, but empowered Eudêmos and Taxiles to take
temporary charge of the affairs of the satrapy. Before
he left Karmania he was rejoined by Krateros who brought
in safety the division of the army which he had led from
the Indus by way of Arachôsia, Drangiana, and the
Karmanian desert. Nearchos also visited his camp, which
at the time was a five days’ journey distant from the sea,
and communicated the welcome news that the fleet had
arrived in safety at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. The
admiral was instructed to continue the voyage by sailing
up the Gulf to the mouth of the Tigris, while Hephaistiôn
was put in command of the main army with orders to
proceed to Sousa along the maritime parts of Persis and
Sousiana. The king himself with a small division took
the upper road which led to that capital through Pasargadai
and Persepolis. In Persis things had not gone well
in his absence. The satrap whom he had appointed was
dead, and his office had been usurped by Orxines, a Persian
of great wealth and high rank, against whom many acts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
violence and oppression were charged. He found also
that the tomb of Cyrus had been desecrated and plundered,
and this outrage excited his violent indignation, since he
looked upon that conqueror as the founder of the vast
empire which was now his own. He could not discover
the perpetrators, but had to content himself with ordering
the violated sepulchre to be properly restored. On reaching
Persepolis he investigated the charges against Orxines,
and finding them proved, put him to death, and gave his
satrapy to Peukestas, one of the commanders of his
bodyguard.</p>

<p>In Persis the health of Kalanos, the Indian gymnosophist,
who, at Alexander’s request, had abjured the
ascetic life and followed him from India, began to fail,
and, as he chose rather to die than suffer the infirmities
of age, he announced that it was his intention to burn himself.
The king attempted to dissuade him, but finding
that he was inexorably bent on self-destruction, ordered a
funeral pyre to be prepared for him, and all the arrangements
connected with his cremation to be superintended
by Ptolemy. On the day appointed the devotee ascended
the pyre and perished in its flames, exhibiting throughout
a serene fortitude and self-possession which greatly
astonished the Macedonians who attended in throngs to
witness this strange spectacle. Strabo makes Pasargadai
to be the scene of this incident, but Diodôros, Sousa, and
with more probability, since we know that Nearchos was
an eye-witness of the burning.</p>

<p>Alexander reached Sousa in the beginning of the year
324 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and remained there for a considerable time,
regulating the affairs of his new dominions. One of his
great objects was to fuse together as far as was practicable
his European with his Asiatic subjects; and to this end
he assigned to some eighty of his generals Asiatic wives,
giving with each an ample dowry. He took himself a
second wife, Barsinê, called sometimes Stateira, the eldest
daughter of Darius, and, it is said, also a third, Parysatis,
the daughter of Ochos, one of the predecessors of Darius.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
About 10,000 Macedonians followed the example of their
superiors, and all who did so received presents from their
royal master. Carrying out this object in another form,
he enrolled a large number of Asiatics among his European
troops. These new schemes were so bitterly resented by
the better class of his Macedonian veterans that they rose
against him in a mutiny which he had no little difficulty
in quelling. About 10,000 of these veterans were dismissed,
and they returned to Europe under the command
of Krateros. Towards the close of the year he went to
Ekbatana, and there he lost his chief favourite Hêphaistiôn,
who succumbed to an attack of fever. His grief at this
bereavement knew no bounds, and showed itself in acts
which seem copied from those wherewith Achilles demonstrated
his passionate sense of the loss of his beloved
Patroklos. From Ekbatana he marched back towards
Babylon, and was met on the way by ambassadors from
all parts of the known world, who came to do homage to
the greatest of all kings and conquerors, and also by a
deputation of Chaldaean priests who warned him of danger
if at that time he should enter Babylon. He entered it
nevertheless, though with gloomy forebodings, early in the
spring of 323 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> As this city was the best point of
communication between the eastern and western parts of
his dominions, he had selected it to be the capital of his
vast empire, and accordingly took measures immediately
on his return for the improvement of its internal condition,
for the drainage of the swampy lands in its neighbourhood
which rendered its climate unhealthy, and also for
removing obstacles to the safe and easy navigation of the
great river by which it communicated with the sea.</p>

<p>His ambition being still, however, unsated, he meditated
fresh conquests, which, if effected, would have made him
master of the world from the shores of the Atlantic to
the Eastern Ocean. But his end was now drawing near.
The climate of Babylon was malarious, and as his spirits
were depressed both by his loss of Hêphaistiôn and
by superstitious fears, he was less able to withstand its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
malignant influences. He caught a fever, and having
aggravated its virulence by indulging in convivial excesses,
was cut off in June 323 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> at the age of thirty-three,
and after he had reigned for nearly thirteen years.
“So passed from the earth,” says Bishop Thirlwall, “one
of the greatest of her sons: great above most for what
he was in himself, and not, as many who have borne the
title, for what was given him to effect. Great, not merely
in the vast compass and the persevering ardour of his
ambition ... but in the course which his ambition
took, in the collateral aims which ennobled and purified
it, so that it almost grew into one with the highest of
which man is capable, the desire of knowledge and the
love of good. In a word, great as one of the benefactors
of his kind.... It may be truly asserted that his was
the first of the great monarchies founded in Asia that
opened a prospect of progressive improvement, and not
of continual degradation, to its subjects: it was the first
that contained any element of moral and intellectual
progress.” This estimate, high as it is, appears to be just
and sober, and to hold a due balance between the extravagant
eulogiums and the damnatory criticisms of other
writers such as Mitford, Williams, and Droysen on the
one hand, and Niebuhr, Sainte-Croix, and Grote on the
other, who all alike allowed their ethical and political
proclivities to bias their judgment.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.—Alexander the Great.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Alexander was dignified both in
his appearance and in his demeanour.
He was not above the ordinary height,
but his frame was well built and extremely
muscular. “He was very
handsome in person,” says Arrian,
“devoted to exertion, of an active
mind and a most heroic courage, tenacious
of honour, ever ready to meet
dangers, indifferent to the pleasures
of the body, and strictly observant of his religious
duties.” Plutarch tells us that the statues of Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
which most resembled him were those of Lysippos,
who alone had his permission to represent him in
marble, and who best hit off the turn of his head,
which leaned a little to one side.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He adds that he was
of a fair complexion, with a tinge of red in his face and
upon his breast, and that his breath and whole person
were so fragrant that they perfumed his under garments.
In another passage, describing Alexander’s habits, the
same author says that he was very temperate in eating,
and that he was not so much addicted to wine as he
was thought to be. What gave rise to this opinion was
his practice of spending a great deal of time at table.
The time, however, was passed rather in talking than
drinking, every cup introducing some long discussion.
Besides, he never sat long at table except when he had
abundance of leisure. There was always a magnificence
at his table, and the expense rose with his fortune till
it came to the fixed sum of 10,000 drachms for each
entertainment. As in his dying moments he had given
orders that his body should be conveyed to Ammôn in
the Libyan oasis, it was embalmed, and after more than
two years had been spent in making preparations for its
removal, it was conveyed with vast pomp in a car of
wondrous magnificence to Egypt, where it was entombed
first at Memphis, and afterwards, by the authority of
Ptolemy,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> at Alexandreia, the greatest of all the cities
which he had founded and called after his name.</p>

<p>Alexander was so prematurely cut off, and was besides
so much occupied before his death with organising fresh
expeditions, both maritime and military, that he had no
time to improve or complete the measures which he had
initiated for promoting the fusion and securing the permanent
unification of the multifarious races comprised
in his empire. Had he been vouchsafed a longer term
of life, it seems probable that he would have succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
in welding so firmly together all the parts of his dominions
that centuries might have elapsed before they became
again disintegrated; but the dissensions which speedily
broke out between his great captains, originating in their
ambition to rule with independent authority, shattered
his empire and embroiled it in wars which lasted for
nearly half a century.</p>

<p>Soon after his death Perdikkas, to whom in his last
moments he had given his signet-ring, was appointed to
conduct the government on behalf of the royal family,
which was held to consist of Arrhidaios, the king’s half-brother,
a man of weak intellect and character, and Queen
Roxana, who a few months after her husband’s death
gave birth to a son who received the name of Alexander
Aigos. The satrapies were then divided among the leading
generals. Perdikkas soon began to use his position
for the furtherance of his own selfish designs, and having
secured the support of Eumenês, attempted to crush his
colleagues and assume all power to himself. He marched
first into Egypt against Ptolemy, but on the banks of
the Nile he was defeated and slain in a mutiny of his
own men 321 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Tidings soon afterwards reached the
army that Krateros had been defeated and slain in fighting
against Eumenês while marching to assist Ptolemy.
The office of regent was upon this offered to Ptolemy,
who declined its acceptance, as he held that the satrapies
should become independent kingdoms. The army then
conferred that office, along with the tutelage of the royal
family, on Antipater of Macedonia, who had crossed over
into Asia to oppose Perdikkas. A new partition of the
provinces, which did not differ much from the former,
was then made at a place in Upper Syria called Triparadeisos.
Under this arrangement Ptolemy held Egypt;
Lysimachos, Thrace; Antigonos, Phrygia or Central Asia
Minor; Seleukos, Babylon; Antigenes, Sousiana; Peukestas,
Persia; Peithôn, son of Krateros, Media; Nearchos,
Pamphylia and Lycia; Arrhidaios, Hellespontine Phrygia;
Antipater and Polysperchon, Macedonia and Greece.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Eumenês still held the satrapy at first assigned to him—that
of Kappadokia, Paphlagonia, and Pontos—and was now the
leader of those who had been the adherents of Perdikkas.
He was supported by Alketas, the brother of Perdikkas,
Peukestas, Attalos, Antigenes, and by the influence of
Olympias, the mother of Alexander. Besides Perdikkas
and Krateros, two other great generals had by this time
disappeared from the scene—Meleager, who had been cut
off by Perdikkas, and Leonnatos, who had been slain in
the Lamian war.</p>

<p>Antigonos was appointed by Antipater to conduct the
war against Eumenês, and after many fluctuations of
fortune at last captured him and put him to death.
This happened early in the year 316 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The fortunes
of Alexander’s empire were then left at the disposal of
five men—Antigonos, Lysimachos, Ptolemy, Seleukos,
and Kassander, the son of Antipater, who had died in
the year 319 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The ambition and ever-increasing
power of Antigonos soon led his colleagues to form a
coalition against him, and a long series of hostilities
followed. In the end Antigonos and his son Dêmêtrios,
surnamed Poliorkêtês, were defeated by the confederates
in the battle of Ipsos in 301 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Antigonos fell on the
field of battle, and the greater part of his dominions fell
to the share of Seleukos, whose cavalry and elephants had
been chiefly instrumental in winning the victory. He
received as his reward a great part of Asia Minor as well
as the whole of Syria from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean.
Ptolemy obtained Phoenicia and Hollow Syria,
but these provinces afterwards gave rise to frequent wars
between succeeding kings of Egypt and Syria. A war
in later times broke out between Seleukos and Lysimachos,
in which the latter was slain in 281 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> His kingdom
of Thrace was afterwards merged in that of Macedonia.
Thus the empire of Alexander, after a period of incessant
wars continued for upwards of forty years, was divided
between the powerful monarchs of Macedonia, Egypt,
and Syria.</p>

<p>The successors of Seleukos were unable to retain hold
of their remote eastern dependencies. About the middle
of the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Theodotos or Diodotos, the
governor of Baktra, revolted from his grandson Antiochos
II. and made Baktra an independent kingdom. Not long
afterwards Aśôka, the grandson of Chandragupta, as we
learn from one of his own inscriptions,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> sent missionaries
to the kings of the West to proclaim to them and to their
subjects the doctrines of Buddhism. The kings named
in the inscription are Antiyoka (Antiochos II., king of
Syria), Turamaya (Ptolemy III., Euergetes, king of Egypt),
Antigona (Antigonas Gonatas, king of Macedonia), Maga
(Magas, king of Kyrênê). About the year 212 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
Antiochos III., surnamed the Great, marched eastward to
recover Parthia and Baktria which had both revolted from
the second Antiochos. He was, however, unable, even after
a war which lasted for some years, to effect the subjugation
of these kingdoms, and accordingly concluded a
treaty with them in which he recognised their independence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
With the assistance of the Baktrian sovereign Euthydêmos,
who founded the greatness of the Baktrian monarchy, he
made an expedition into India, where he renewed the
alliance with that country which had been formed in the
days of Sandrokottos. From Sophagasenos,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the chief of
the Indian kings, he obtained a large supply of elephants,
and then returned to Syria by the route through Arachôsia
in the year 205 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXII.—Alexander crosses the Indian Kaukasos to
invade India and advances to the river Kôphên</i></h5>

<p>After capturing the Rock of Choriênês, Alexander
went himself to Baktra, but despatched Krateros with
600 of the Companion Cavalry<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and a force of infantry,
consisting of his own brigade with that of Polysperchôn
and Attalos and that of Alketas, against Katanês and
Austanês the only chiefs now left in the country of the
Paraitakênai<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> who still held out against him. In the
battle which ensued Krateros after a severe struggle proved
victorious. Katanês fell in the action, while Austanês
was made prisoner and brought to Alexander. Of the
barbarians who had followed them to the field, there were
slain 120 horsemen and about 1500 foot. Krateros after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
the victory led his troops also to Baktra. While Alexander
was here the tragic incident in his history, the
affair of Kallisthenês and the pages, occurred.</p>

<p>When spring was now past,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> he led his army from
Baktra to invade the Indians, leaving Amyntas in the land
of the Baktrians with 3500 horse and 10,000 foot. In
ten days he crossed the Kaukasos<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and arrived at the city
of Alexandreia<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> which he had founded in the land of the
Parapamisadai<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> when he first marched to Baktra. The
ruler whom he had then set over the city he dismissed
from his office because he thought he had not discharged
its duties well. He recruited the population of Alexandreia
with fresh settlers from the surrounding district,
and also with such of his soldiers as were unfit for further
service.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> He then ordered Nikanor, one of the Companions,
to take charge of the city itself and regulate its affairs,
but he appointed Tyriaspes satrap of the land of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Parapamisadai and the rest of the country as far as the
river Kôphên.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Having reached the city of Nikaia<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and
sacrificed to the goddess Athêna, he despatched a herald
to Taxilês<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and the chiefs on this side of the river Indus,
directing them to meet him where it was most convenient
for each. Taxilês accordingly and the other chiefs did
meet him and brought him such presents as are most
esteemed by the Indians. They offered also to give him
the elephants which they had with them amounting in
number to five-and-twenty.</p>

<p>Having here divided his army, he despatched Hêphaistiôn
and Perdikkas with the brigades of Gorgias, Kleitos,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and Meleager, half of the companion cavalry, and the
whole of the mercenary cavalry, to the land of Peukelaôtis<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and the river Indus.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> He ordered them either to seize
by force whatever places lay on their route or to accept
their submission if they capitulated, and when they came
to the Indus to make whatever preparations were necessary
for the transport of the army across that river.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
They were accompanied on their march by Taxilês and
the other chiefs. On reaching the river Indus they began
to carry out the instructions which they had received
from Alexander. One of the chiefs, however, Astês, a
prince of the land of Peukelaôtis, revolted, but perished
in the attempt, besides involving in ruin the city to which
he had fled for refuge, which the troops under Hêphaistiôn
captured in thirty days. Astês himself fell, and Sanggaios,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
who had some time before fled from Astês and
deserted to Taxilês, a circumstance which guaranteed his
fidelity to Alexander, was appointed governor of the
city.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXIII.—Alexander wars against the Aspasians</i></h5>

<p>Alexander took command in person of the other
division of the army, consisting of the hypaspists,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> all
the companion cavalry except what was with Hêphaistiôn,
the brigades of infantry called the foot-companions, the
archers, the Agrianians, and the horse lancers, and
advanced into the country of the Aspasians and Gouraians
and Assakênians.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The route which he followed<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
was hilly and rugged, and lay along the course of the
river called the Khôês,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> which he had difficulty in crossing.
This done he ordered the mass of the infantry to
follow leisurely, while he rode rapidly forward, taking
with him the whole of his cavalry, besides 800 Macedonian
foot soldiers, whom he mounted on horseback
with their infantry shields; for he had been informed
that the barbarians inhabiting those parts had fled for
refuge to their native mountains, and to such of their
cities as were strongly fortified. When he proceeded to
attack the first city of this kind that came in his way, he
found men drawn up before it in battle order, and on
these he fell at once, just as he was, put them to rout,
and shut them up within the gates. He was wounded,
however, in the shoulder by a dart which penetrated
through his breast-plate, but not severely, for the breast-plate
prevented the weapon from going right through his
shoulder. Ptolemy, the son of Lagos, and Leonnatos were
also wounded.</p>

<p>He then encamped near the city on the side where he
thought the wall was weakest. Next day, as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
there was light, the Macedonians attacked the outer of
the two walls by which the city was encompassed, and as
it was but rudely constructed they captured it without
difficulty. At the inner wall, however, the barbarians
made some resistance; but when the ladders were applied,
and the defenders were galled with darts wherever
they turned, they no longer stood their ground, but
issued from the city through the gates and made for the
hills. Some of them perished in the flight, while such
as were taken alive were to a man put to death by the
Macedonians, who were enraged against them for having
wounded Alexander. Most of them, however, made good
their escape to the mountains, which lay at no great
distance from the city. Alexander razed it to the
ground, and then marched forward to another city called
Andaka, which surrendered on capitulation. When the
place had thus fallen into his hands he left Krateros in
these parts, with the other infantry officers, to take by
force whatever other cities refused voluntary submission,
and to settle the affairs of the surrounding district in the
best way existing circumstances would permit, while he
himself advanced to the river Euaspla,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> where the chief
of the Aspasians was.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXIV.—Operations against the Aspasians</i></h5>

<p>In this expedition Alexander took with him the
hypaspists, the archers, the Agrianians, the brigade of
Koinos and Attalos, the cavalry guard, about four squadrons
of the other companion cavalry, and one half of the
mounted archers. After a long march he reached, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
the second day, the city of the Aspasian chief.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The
barbarians on hearing of his approach set fire to their
city and fled to the mountains. But Alexander’s men
followed close at the heels of the fugitives, as far as
the mountains, and made a great slaughter of the barbarians
before they could escape to rough and difficult
ground.</p>

<p>During the pursuit Ptolemy, the son of Lagos, descried
the chief of the Indians of that country standing at the
time on a small eminence, with some of his shield-bearing
guards around him, and, although his own following was
much smaller, he nevertheless continued the chase, being
still on horseback. When the ascent, however, became
so difficult that his charger could no longer mount it at a
good pace, he left him there, and handing him over to
one of the hypaspists to lead, he proceeded on foot,
just as he was, to come up with the Indian. The latter
on seeing that Ptolemy was now near at hand, turned
round to face him, as did also his shield-bearing guards.
The Indian, closing with his adversary, struck him on the
breast with a long spear which pierced his cuirass, but
the cuirass broke all the force of the blow. Ptolemy, on
the other hand, smote the Indian right through the thigh,
laid him prone at his feet, and stripped him of his arms.
When his men saw their leader lying dead they left the
place, but the other Indians, when they saw on looking
from the mountains that the dead body of their chief was
being carried off by the enemy, were filled with grief and
rage, and rushing down to the small eminence fought for
the recovery of the corpse with the utmost determination;
for by this time Alexander also was on the eminence, and
had brought with him the infantry soldiers, who had now
alighted from their horses. This reinforcement falling
upon the Indians succeeded after a hard struggle in
driving them off to the mountains and securing the
possession of the dead body.</p>

<p>Alexander then crossed the mountains, and came to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
city at their base, named Arigaion.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> He found that the
inhabitants had burned the place and taken to flight.
Here Krateros, with his staff and the troops under his
command, rejoined him, after having fully carried out all the
orders given by the king. As the city seemed to occupy
a very advantageous site, he commanded Krateros to
fortify it strongly, and people it with as many natives of
the neighbourhood as should consent to make it their
home, together with any soldiers found unfit for further
service. He then marched to a place where, as he had
ascertained, most of the barbarians of that part of the
country had taken refuge, and on reaching a certain
mountain encamped at its base.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ptolemy, the son of Lagos, who had been
sent out by Alexander to procure forage, and had gone
with a few followers a considerable distance in advance
to reconnoitre the enemy, came back to Alexander to
report that he had seen more fires where the barbarians
were posted than in Alexander’s camp. Alexander, without
believing that the fires were so numerous, was still convinced
that a host of barbarians had mustered together
from the surrounding country, and therefore leaving a
part of his army where it was encamped in proximity to
the mountain, he took with him such a force as the
reports led him to think would be adequate, and when
the fires were near in view, he divided it into three parts.
The command of one part he gave to Leonnatos, an
officer of the bodyguard, placing under him the brigade
of Attalos, along with that of Balakros. The command
of the second division he gave to Ptolemy, the son of
Lagos. It consisted of a third of the royal hypaspists,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
together with the brigade of Philippos and Philôtas, two
companies of archers, each a thousand strong, the Agrianians,
and half of the horsemen. The third division
Alexander led in person against the position occupied by
the main body of the barbarians.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXV.—Defeat of the Aspasians—The
Assakenians and Gouraians attacked</i></h5>

<p>When they saw the Macedonians advancing against
them they came down from the high ground which they
had occupied into the plain below, confident in their
numbers, and despising the Macedonians for the smallness
of theirs. A sharp conflict followed, but Alexander
without much trouble gained the victory. Ptolemy did
not draw up his men in line upon the plain, but since
the barbarians were posted on a small hill, he formed his
battalions into column, and led them up the hill on the
side where it was most assailable. He did not surround
the entire circuit of the hill, but left an opening for the
barbarians by which to escape if they meant flight.
With these men also the conflict was sharp, not only
from the difficult nature of the ground, but also because
the Indians were of a different mettle from the other
barbarians there, and were by far the stoutest warriors
in that neighbourhood; but brave as they were they
were driven from the hill by the Macedonians. The
men of the third division under Leonnatos were equally
successful, as they also routed those with whom they
engaged. Ptolemy states that the men taken prisoners
were in all above 40,000, and that there were also captured
more than 230,000 oxen, from which Alexander
chose out the best—those which he thought superior to
the others both for beauty and size—with a view to send
them to Macedonia to be employed in agriculture.</p>

<p>He marched thence to invade the country of the
Assakenians, for they were reported to have under arms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
and ready for battle an army of 20,000 cavalry and
more than 30,000 infantry, besides 30 elephants.
Krateros had now completed the work of fortifying the
city which he had been left to plant with colonists, and
rejoined Alexander with the heavy armed troops and
the engines which it might be necessary to employ in
besieging towns. Alexander himself then proceeded to
attack the Assakenians, taking with him the companion
cavalry, the horse archers, the brigade of Koinos and
Polysperchon, and the thousand Agrianians and the
archers. He passed through the country of the Gouraians,
where he had to cross the Gouraios,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the river
named after that country. The passage was difficult
on account of the depth and swiftness of the stream,
and also because the stones at the bottom were so
smooth and round that the men on stepping on them
were apt to stumble. When the barbarians saw Alexander
approaching they had not the courage to encounter
him in the open field with their collective forces, but
dispersed to their several cities, which they resolved to
defend to the last extremity.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXVI.—Siege of Massaga</i></h5>

<p>Alexander marched first to attack Massaga,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> which was
the greatest city in those parts. When he was now
approaching the walls, the barbarians, supported by a body
of Indian mercenaries brought from a distance, and no less
than 7000 strong, sallied out with a run against the
Macedonians when they observed them preparing to encamp.
Alexander thus saw that the battle would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
fought close to the city, whereas he wished the enemy to
be drawn away to a distance from the walls, so that, if
they were defeated, as he was certain they would be, they
might have less chance of escaping with their lives by a
short flight into the city. Alexander therefore ordered
the Macedonians to fall back to a little hill which was
about seven stadia distant from the place where he had
meant to encamp. This gave the enemy fresh courage
as they thought the Macedonians had already given way
before them, and so they charged them at a running
pace and without any observance of order. But when
once their arrows began to reach his men, Alexander
immediately wheeled round at a signal agreed on and led
the phalanx at a running pace to fall upon them. But his
horse-lancers and the Agrianians and the archers darted
forward, and were the first to come into conflict with the
barbarians, while he was leading the phalanx in regular
order into action. The Indians were confounded by this
unexpected attack, and no sooner found themselves involved
in a hand-to-hand encounter than they gave way
and fled back to the city. About 200 of them were killed,
and the rest were shut up within the walls. Alexander
brought up the phalanx against the fortifications, but was
wounded in the ankle, though not severely, by an arrow
shot from the battlements. The next day he brought up
the military engines, and without much difficulty battered
down a part of the wall. But when the Macedonians
attempted to force their way through the breach which had
been made, the Indians repelled all their attacks with so
much spirit that Alexander was obliged for that day to draw
off his forces. On the morrow the Macedonians renewed
their assault with even greater vigour, and a wooden tower
was brought up against the wall from which the archers
shot at the Indians, while missiles were discharged against
them from engines. They were thus driven back to a
good distance, but still their assailants were after all unable
to force their way within the walls.</p>

<p>On the third day Alexander led the phalanx once more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
to the assault, and causing a bridge to be thrown from an
engine over to that part of the wall which had been
battered down, by that gangway he led the hypaspists over
to the breach—the same men who by a similar expedient
had enabled him to capture Tyre. The bridge, however,
broke down under the great throng which was pushing
forward with eager haste, and the Macedonians fell with
it. The barbarians on the walls, seeing what had happened,
began amid loud cheering to ply the Macedonians with
stones and arrows and whatever missiles they had ready
at hand or could at the moment snatch up, while others
sallying out from posterns in the wall between the towers,
struck them at close quarters before they could extricate
themselves from the confusion caused by the accident.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXVII.—Massaga taken by storm—Ora and
Bazira besieged</i></h5>

<p>Alexander then sent Alketas with his brigade to take
up the wounded and recall to the camp the active combatants.
On the fourth day another gangway on a
different engine was despatched by him against the wall.</p>

<p>Now the Indians, as long as the chief of that place was
still living, continued with great vigour to maintain the
defence, but when he was struck by a missile from an
engine and was killed by the blow, while some of themselves
had fallen in the uninterrupted siege, and most of
them were wounded and disabled for fighting, they sent
a herald to treat with Alexander. To him it was
always a pleasure to save the lives of brave men, and he
came to an agreement with the Indian mercenaries to
the effect that they should change their side and take
service in his ranks. Upon this they left the city, arms
in hand, and encamped by themselves on a small hill
which faced the camp of the Macedonians. But as they
had no wish to take up arms against their own countrymen,
they resolved to arise by night and make off with all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
speed to their homes. When Alexander was informed of
this he surrounded the hill that same night with all his
troops, and having thus intercepted the Indians in the
midst of their flight, cut them to pieces. The city now
stripped of its defenders he took by storm, and captured
the mother and daughter of Assakênos.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Alexander lost
in the siege from first to last five-and-twenty of his men
in all.</p>

<p>He then despatched Koinos to Bazira,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> convinced that
the inhabitants would capitulate on learning that Massaga
had been captured. He, moreover, sent Attalos, Alketas,
and Dêmêtrios, the captain of cavalry, to another city,
Ora, instructing them to draw a rampart round it, and to
invest it until his own arrival. The inhabitants of this
place sallied out against the troops under Alketas, but the
Macedonians had no great difficulty in routing them, and
driving them back within the walls of the city. As regards
Koinos, matters did not go well with him at Bazira, for as
it stood on a very lofty eminence, and was strongly fortified
in every quarter, the people trusted to the strength of their
position and made no proposals about surrendering.</p>

<p>Alexander, on learning this, set out for Bazira, but as
he knew that some of the barbarians of the neighbouring
country were going to steal unobserved into the city of
Ora, having been sent by Abisares<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> for this very purpose,
he directed his march first to that city. He then sent
orders to Koinos to fortify some strong position as a basis
of operations against the city of the Bazirians, and to leave
in it a sufficient garrison to prevent the inhabitants from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
going into the country around for provisions without
fear of danger. He was then to join Alexander with the
remainder of his troops. When the men of Bazira saw
Koinos departing with the bulk of his troops they regarded
the Macedonians who remained, as contemptible antagonists,
and sallied out into the plain to attack them. A
sharp conflict ensued in which 500 of the barbarians were
slain, and upwards of 70 taken prisoners. The rest fled
together into the city and were more rigorously than ever
debarred all access to the country by the garrison of the
fort. The siege of Ora did not cost Alexander much
labour, for he captured the place at the first assault, and
got possession of all the elephants which had been left
therein.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXVIII.—Bazira captured—Alexander marches
to the rock Aornos</i></h5>

<p>When the inhabitants of Bazira heard that Ora had
fallen, they regarded their case as desperate, and at the
dead of night fled from their city to the Rock, as all the
other barbarians were doing, for, having left their cities,
they were fleeing to the rock in that land called Aornos;<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
for this is a mighty mass of rock in that part of the
country, and a report is current concerning it that even
Heraklês, the son of Zeus, had found it to be impregnable.
Now whether the Theban, or the Tyrian, or the Egyptian
Heraklês penetrated so far as to the Indians<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> I can neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
positively affirm nor deny, but I incline to think that he
did not penetrate so far; for we know how common it
is for men when speaking of things that are difficult
to magnify the difficulty by declaring that it would
baffle even Heraklês himself. And in the case of this
rock my own conviction is that Heraklês was mentioned
to make the story of its capture all the more wonderful.
The rock is said to have had a circuit of about 200 stadia,
and at its lowest elevation a height of eleven stadia.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> It was
ascended by a single path cut by the hand of man, yet
difficult. On the summit of the rock there was, it is also
said, plenty of pure water which gushed out from a copious
spring. There was timber besides, and as much good
arable land as required for its cultivation the labour of a
thousand men.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.—The Tyrian Heraklês.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Alexander on learning these particulars was seized
with an ardent desire to capture this mountain also, the
story current about Heraklês not being the least of the
incentives. With this in view he made Ora and Massaga
strongholds for bridling the districts around them, and at
the same time strengthened the defences of Bazira. The
division under Hêphaistiôn and Perdikkas fortified for him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
another city called Orobatis<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> in which they left a garrison
and then marched on to the river Indus. On reaching it
they began preparing a bridge to span the Indus in
accordance with Alexander’s orders.</p>

<p>Alexander now appointed Nikanor, one of the companions,
satrap of the country on this side of the Indus,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
and then first marched himself towards that river and
received the submission of the city of Peukelaôtis which
lay not far from the Indus. He placed in it a garrison of
Macedonian soldiers under the command of Philippos, and
then occupied himself in reducing other towns—some
small ones—situated near the river Indus.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He was
accompanied on this occasion by Kôphaios and Assagetês
the local chiefs.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> On reaching Embolima,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> a city close<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
adjoining the rock of Aornos,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> he there left Krateros with
a part of the army to gather into the city as much corn as
possible and all other requisites for a long stay, that the
Macedonians having this place as the basis of their
operations might, during a protracted siege, wear out the
defenders of the rock by famine, should it fail to be
captured at the first assault. He himself then advanced
to the rock, taking with him the archers, the Agrianians,
the brigade of Koinos, the lightest and best-armed men
selected from the remainder of the phalanx, 200 of the
companion cavalry, and 100 horse-archers. At the end
of the day’s march he encamped on what he took to be a
convenient site. The next day he advanced a little nearer
to the Rock, and again encamped.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXIX.—Siege of Aornos</i></h5>

<p>Some men thereupon who belonged to the neighbourhood
came to him, and after proffering their submission
undertook to guide him to the most assailable part of the
rock, that from which it would not be difficult to capture
the place. With these men he sent Ptolemy, the son of
Lagos, a member of the bodyguard, leading the Agrianians
and the other light-armed troops and the selected hypaspists,
and directed him, on securing the position, to hold it with
a strong guard and to signal to him when he had occupied
it. Ptolemy, who followed a route which proved rough
and otherwise difficult to traverse, succeeded in occupying
the position without being perceived by the barbarians.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
The whole circuit of this he fortified with a palisade
and a trench, and then raised a beacon on the mountain
from which the flame was likely to be seen by
Alexander. Alexander did see it, and next day moved
forward with his army, but as the barbarians obstructed
his progress he could do nothing more on account of the
difficult nature of the ground. When the barbarians
perceived that Alexander had found an attack to be
impracticable, they turned round, and in full force fell
upon Ptolemy’s men. Between these and the Macedonians
hard fighting ensued, the Indians making strenuous efforts
to destroy the palisade by tearing up the stakes, and
Ptolemy to guard and maintain his position. The barbarians
were worsted in the skirmish and when night
began to fall withdrew.</p>

<p>From the Indian deserters Alexander selected one
who knew the country and could otherwise be trusted,
and sent him by night to Ptolemy with a letter importing
that when he himself assailed the rock, Ptolemy should
no longer content himself with defending his position but
should fall upon the barbarians on the mountain, so that
the Indians, being attacked in front and rear, might be
perplexed how to act. Alexander, starting at daybreak
from his camp, led his army by the route followed by
Ptolemy when he went up unobserved, being convinced
that if he forced a passage that way, and effected a
junction with Ptolemy’s men, the work still before him
would not then be difficult; and so it turned out; for up
to mid-day there continued to be hard fighting between
the Indians and the Macedonians—the latter forcing their
way up the ascent, while the former plied them with
missiles as they ascended. But as the Macedonians did
not slacken their efforts, ascending the one after the other,
while those in advance paused to rest, they gained with
much pain and toil the summit of the pass early in the
afternoon, and joined Ptolemy’s men. His troops being
now all united, Alexander put them again in motion and
led them against the rock itself; but to get close up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
to it was not yet practicable. So came this day to
its end.</p>

<p>Next day at dawn he ordered the soldiers to cut a
hundred stakes per man. When the stakes had been cut
he began piling them up towards the rock (beginning
from the crown of the hill on which the camp had been
pitched) to form a great mound, whence he thought it would
be possible for arrows and for missiles shot from engines
to reach the defenders. Every one took part in the work
helping to advance the mound. Alexander himself was
present to superintend, commending those that were intent
on getting the work done, and chastising any one that at
the moment was idling.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXX.—Capture of Aornos—Advance to
the Indus</i></h5>

<p>The army by the first day’s work extended the mound
the length of a stadium, and on the following day the
slingers by slinging stones at the Indians from the mound
just constructed, and the bolts shot at them from the
engines, drove them back whenever they sallied out to
attack the men engaged upon the mound. The work of
piling it up thus went on for three days, without intermission,
when on the fourth day a few Macedonians forced
their way to a small hill which was on a level with the
rock, and occupied its crest. Alexander without ever
resting drove the mound towards the hill which the handful
of men had occupied, his object being to join the two
together.</p>

<p>But the Indians terror-struck both by the unheard-of
audacity of the Macedonians in forcing their way to the
hill, and also by seeing that this position was now connected
with the mound, abstained from further resistance,
and, sending their herald to Alexander, professed they
were willing to surrender the rock if he granted them
terms of capitulation. But the purpose they had in view<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
was to consume the day in spinning out negotiations, and
to disperse by night to their several homes. When Alexander
saw this he allowed them to start off as well as to
withdraw the sentinels from the whole circle of outposts.
He did not himself stir until they began their retreat, but,
when they did so, he took with him 700 of the bodyguards
and the hypaspists and scaled the rock at the
point abandoned by the enemy. He was himself the first
to reach the top, the Macedonians ascending after him
pulling one another up, some at one place and some at
another. Then at a preconcerted signal they turned upon
the retreating barbarians and slew many of them in the
flight, besides so terrifying some others that in retreating
they flung themselves down the precipices, and were in consequence
dashed to death. Alexander thus became master
of the rock which had baffled Heraklês himself. He sacrificed
upon it and built a fort, giving the command of its
garrison to Sisikottos,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> who long before had in Baktra
deserted from the Indians to Bessos, but after Alexander
had conquered the Baktrian land served in his army, and
showed himself a man worthy of all confidence.</p>

<p>He then set out from the rock and invaded the land
of the Assakênians,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> for he had been apprised that the
brother of Assakênos, with the elephants and a host of the
barbarians from the adjoining country, had fled for refuge
to the mountains of that land. On reaching Dyrta<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> he
found there were no inhabitants either in the city itself
or the surrounding district. So next day he sent out
Nearchos and Antiochos, commanders of the hypaspists,
the former with the light-armed Agrianians, and the latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
with his own regiment and other two regiments besides.
They were despatched to examine the nature of the
localities, and to capture, if possible, some of the barbarians
who might give information about the state of
matters in the country, and particularly about the
elephants, as he was very anxious to know where
they were.</p>

<p>He himself now marched towards the river Indus, and
the army going on before made a road for him, without
which there would have been no means of passing through
that part of the country.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> He there captured a few of
the barbarians, from whom he learned that the Indians of
the country had fled away for refuge to Abisarês,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> but had
left their elephants there at pasture near the river Indus.
He ordered these men to show him the way to the
elephants. Now many of the Indians are elephant
hunters,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and men of this class found favour with him
and were kept in his retinue, and on this occasion he
went with them in pursuit of the elephants. Two of
these animals were killed in the chase by throwing themselves
down a steep place, but the others on being caught
suffered drivers to mount them, and were added to the
army. He was further fortunate in finding serviceable
timber<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> along the river, and this was cut for him by the
army and employed in building boats. These were
taken down the river Indus to the bridge which a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
good while before this Hêphaistiôn and Perdikkas had
constructed.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Fifth Book</span></h4>

<h5><i>Chapter I.—Alexander at Nysa</i></h5>

<p>In the country traversed by Alexander between the
Kôphên and the river Indus, they say that besides the
cities already mentioned, there stood also the city of
Nysa,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> which owed its foundation to Dionysos, and that
Dionysos founded it when he conquered the Indians,
whoever this Dionysos in reality was, and when or
whencesoever he made his expedition against the Indians;
for I have no means of deciding whether the Theban
Dionysos setting out either from Thebes or the Lydian
Tmôlos<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> marched with an army against the Indians,
passing through a great many warlike nations unknown
to the Greeks of those days, but without subjugating
any of them by force of arms except only the Indian
nations; all I know is, that one is not called on to sift
minutely the legends of antiquity concerning the gods;
for things that are not credible, if one reasons as to their
consistency with the course of nature, do not seem to be
incredible altogether if one takes the divine agency into
account.</p>

<p>When Alexander came to Nysa, the Nysaians sent out
to him their president, whose name was Akouphis,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and
along with him thirty deputies of their most eminent
citizens, to entreat him to spare the city for the sake of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the god. The deputies, it is said, on entering Alexander’s
tent found him sitting in his armour, covered with dust
from his journey, wearing his helmet and grasping his
spear. They fell to the ground in amazement at the sight,
and remained for a long time silent. But when Alexander
had bidden them rise and to be of good courage, then
Akouphis taking up speech thus addressed him.</p>

<p>“The Nysaians entreat you, O King! to permit them
to be still free and to be governed by their own laws
from reverence towards Dionysos; for when Dionysos
after conquering the Indian nation was returning to the
shores of Greece he founded with his war-worn soldiers,
who were also his bacchanals, this very city to be a
memorial to posterity of his wanderings and his victory,
just as you have founded yourself an Alexandreia near
Kaukasos, and another Alexandreia in the land of the
Egyptians, not to speak of many others, some of which
you have already founded, while others will follow in
the course of time, just as your achievements exceed in
number those displayed by Dionysos. Now Dionysos
called our city Nysa, and our land the Nysaian, after
the name of his nurse Nysa; and he besides gave
to the mountain which lies near the city the name of
Mêros, because according to the legend he grew, before
his birth, in the thigh of Zeus. And from his time forth
we inhabit Nysa as a free city, and are governed by our
own laws, and are a well-ordered community. But that
Dionysos was our founder, take this as a proof, that ivy
which grows nowhere else in the land of the Indians,
grows with us.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter II.—Alexander permits the Nysaians to retain their
Autonomy—Visits Mount Mêros</i></h5>

<p>It gratified Alexander to hear all this, for he was
desirous that the legends concerning the wanderings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
Dionysos should be believed, as well as that Nysa owed
its foundation to Dionysos, since he had himself reached
the place to which that deity had come, and meant to
penetrate farther than he; for the Macedonians, he
thought, would not refuse to share his toils if he advanced
with an ambition to rival the exploits of Dionysos. He
therefore confirmed the inhabitants of Nysa in the enjoyment
of their freedom and their own laws; and when he
enquired about their laws, he praised them because the
government of their state was in the hands of the
aristocracy. He moreover requested them to send with
him 300 of their horsemen, together with 100 of their
best men selected from the governing body, which consisted
of 300 members. He then asked Akouphis, whom
he appointed governor of the Nysaian land, to make the
selection. When Akouphis heard this, he is said to have
smiled at the request, and when Alexander asked him
why he laughed, to have replied, “How, O King! can a
single city if deprived of a hundred of its best men continue
to be well-governed? But if you have the welfare
of the Nysaians at heart, take with you the 300 horsemen,
or, if you wish, even more; but instead of the hundred of
our best men you have asked me to select, take with you
twice that number of our worst men, so that on your
returning hither you may find the city as well governed
as it is now.” By these words he persuaded Alexander,
who thought he spoke sensibly, and who ordered him to
send the horsemen without again asking for the hundred
men who were to have been selected, or even for others
to supply their place. He requested Akouphis, however,
to send him his son and his daughter’s son to attend him
on his expedition.</p>

<p>Alexander felt a strong desire to see the place where
the Nysaians boasted to have certain memorials of Dionysos.
So he went, it is said, to Mount Mêros with the
companion cavalry and the body of foot-guards, and
found that the mountain abounded with ivy and laurel
and umbrageous groves of all manner of trees, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
it had also chases supplied with game of every description.
The Macedonians, to whom the sight of the ivy was particularly
welcome, as it was the first they had seen for
a long time (there being no ivy in the land of the Indians,
even where they have the vine), are said to have set themselves
at once to weave ivy chaplets, and, accoutred as they
were, to have crowned themselves with these, chanting
the while hymns to Dionysos and invoking the god by
his different names.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Alexander, they say, offered while
there sacrifice to Dionysos and feasted with his friends.
Some even go so far as to allege, if any one cares to
believe such things, that many of his courtiers, Macedonians
of no mean rank, while invoking Dionysos,
and wreathed with ivy crowns, were seized with the
inspiration of the god, raised in his honour shouts of
Evoi, and revelled like Bacchanals celebrating the orgies.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter III—How Eratosthenes views the legends concerning
Heraklês and Dionysos—Alexander crosses
the Indus</i></h5>

<p>Any one who hears these stories is free to believe them
or disbelieve them as he chooses. For my own part, I
do not altogether agree with Eratosthenes the Kyrênian,
who says that all these references to the deity were
circulated by the Macedonians in connection with the
deeds of Alexander, to gratify his pride by grossly
exaggerating their importance. For, to take an instance,
he says that the Macedonians, on seeing a cavern among
the Paropamisadai, and either hearing some local legend
about it, or inventing one themselves, spread a report
that this was beyond doubt the cave in which Promêtheus
had been bound, and to which the eagle resorted to prey
upon his vitals, until Heraklês, coming that way, slew the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
eagle and freed Promêtheus from his bonds.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> And again,
he says that the Macedonians transferred the name of
Mount Kaukasos from Pontos to the eastern parts of the
world and the land of the Paropamisadai adjacent to
India (for they called Mount Paropamisos, Kaukasos), to
enhance the glory of Alexander as if he had passed over
Kaukasos. And again, he says that when the Macedonians
saw in India itself oxen marked with a brand in
the form of a club, they took this as a proof that Heraklês
had gone as far as the Indians. Eratosthenes has likewise
no belief in similar stories about the wanderings of
Dionysos. Whether or not the accounts about them are
true, I cannot decide, and so leave them.</p>

<p>When Alexander arrived at the river Indus he found
a bridge already made over it by Hêphaistiôn, and two
thirty-oared galleys, besides a great many small boats.
He found also a present which had been sent by Taxilês
the Indian, consisting of 200 talents of silver, 3000 oxen
fattened for the shambles, 10,000 sheep or more, and 30
elephants. The same prince had also sent to his assistance
a force of 700 horsemen, and these brought word
that Taxilês surrendered into his hands his capital Taxila,
the greatest of all the cities between the river Indus and
the Hydaspês. Alexander there offered sacrifices to the
gods to whom it was his custom to sacrifice, and entertained
his army with gymnastic and equestrian contests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
on the banks of the river. The sacrifices proved to be
favourable for his undertaking the passage.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter IV.—General description of the Indus
and of the people of India</i></h5>

<p>That the Indus is the greatest of all the rivers of
Asia, except the Ganges, which is itself an Indian river;
that its sources lie on this side of the Paropamisos or
Kaukasos;<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that it falls into the great sea which washes
the shores of India towards the south wind; that it has
two mouths, both of which outlets abound with shallows,
like the five mouths of the Ister; and that it forms a
delta in the land of the Indians closely resembling the
Egyptian Delta, and that this is called in the Indian tongue
Pâtâla,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> let this be my description of the Indus, setting
forth those facts which can least be disputed, since the
Hydaspês and the Akesinês and the Hydraôtês and the
Hyphasis, which are also Indian rivers, are considerably
larger than any other rivers in Asia, but are smaller, I
may even say much smaller, than the Indus, just as also
the Indus itself is smaller than the Ganges. Indeed,
Ktêsias (if any one thinks him a proper authority) states<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
that where the Indus is narrowest its banks are 40 stadia
apart, and where broadest 100 stadia, while its ordinary
breadth is the mean between these two distances.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>This river Indus Alexander began to cross at daybreak
with his army to enter the country of the Indians.
Concerning this people I have, in this present work,
described neither under what laws they live, nor what
strange animals their country produces, nor in what
number and variety fish and water-monsters are bred
in the Indus, the Hydaspês, the Ganges, and other Indian
rivers. Nor have I described the ants which dig up gold
for them, nor its guardians the griffins,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> nor other stories
invented rather to amuse than to convey a knowledge of
facts, since there was no one to expose the falsehood of
any absurd stories told about the Indians. However,
Alexander and those who served in his army did expose
the falsehood of most of them, although some even of these
very men invented lies of their own. They proved also,
in contradiction of the common belief, that the Indians were
goldless, those tribes at least, and they were many, which
Alexander visited with his army; and that they were not
at all luxurious in their style of living, while they were
of so great a stature<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> that they were amongst the tallest
men in Asia, being five cubits in height, or nearly so. They
were blacker than any other men except the Aethiopians,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
while in the art of war they were far superior to the other
nations by which Asia was at that time inhabited. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
I cannot make any proper comparison between the Indians
and the race of ancient Persians, who, under the command
of Cyrus, the son of Kambyses, wrested the supremacy of
Asia from the Medes, and added to their empire other
nations, some by conquest and others by voluntary submission;
for the Persians of those days were but a poor
people, inhabiting a rugged country and approximating
closely in the austerity of their laws and usages to the
Spartan discipline.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Then with regard to the discomfiture
of the Persians in the Skythian land, I cannot with
certainty conjecture to what cause it was attributable,
whether to the difficult nature of the country into which
they were led, or to some other mistake made by Cyrus,
or whether it was that the Persians were inferior in the
art of war to those Skythians whose territories they
invaded.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter V.—The rivers and mountains of Asia</i></h5>

<p>However, I shall treat of the Indians in a separate
work,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> in which I shall set down whatever seems to be
most credible in the reports supplied by those who
accompanied Alexander in his expedition, and by
Nearchos who made a voyage round the Great Sea which
adjoins the Indians. I shall then add the accounts of the
country which were compiled by Megasthenes and
Eratosthenês, who are both writers of standard authority.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
I shall describe the customs of the Indians and the
remarkable animals which their country is said to produce,
and also the voyage which was made by Nearchos in the
outer sea.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> In the meantime it will suffice if I content
myself with describing only what seems requisite to make
the account of Alexander’s operations clearly intelligible.
Mount Tauros divides Asia, beginning from Mykalê, the
mountain which lies opposite to the island of Samos;
then forming the boundary of the country of the Pamphylians
and Kilikians, it stretches onwards to Armenia.
From the Armenians it passes into Mêdia, and runs
through the country of the Parthians and the Khorasmians.
Reaching Baktria it there unites with Mount Parapamisos,
which the Macedonians of Alexander’s army called the
Kaukasos, for the purpose, it is said, of magnifying the
deeds of Alexander, for it could thus be said that he had
carried his victorious arms even beyond the Kaukasos.
It is possible, however, that this mountain range may be
a continuation of that other Kaukasos which is in Skythia,
in the same way as it is a continuation of the Tauric
range. For this reason I have before this occasionally
called this range Kaukasos, and in future I mean to call
it so. This Kaukasos extends as far as the great Indian
Ocean in the direction of the east.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> All the important
rivers of Asia accordingly rise either in Mount Tauros or
Mount Kaukasos, and shape their courses some to the
north, and others to the south. Those which run northward
discharge their waters either into the Maiôtic Lake,
or into the Hyrkanian Sea, which is in reality a gulf of
the Great Sea.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The rivers which run southward are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
Euphrates, Tigris, Indus, Hydaspês, Akesines, Hydraôtes,
and Hyphasis, together with the rivers between these and
the Ganges. All these either enter the sea, or, like the
Euphrates, disappear among the swamps which receive
their waters.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter VI.—Position and boundaries of India and how
its plains may have been formed</i></h5>

<p>If anyone takes this view of Asia, that it is divided
by the Tauros and the Kaukasos from west to east,
then he finds that it is formed by the Tauros itself into
two great sections, one of which lies towards the south
and the south wind, and the other towards the north and
the north wind. The southern section is divided into
four parts, of which, according to Eratosthenês, India is
the largest, this being also the opinion of Megasthenes
who resided with Siburtios the satrap of Arakhôsia, and
who tells us that he frequently visited Sandrakottos the
king of the Indians.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> They say that the smallest part is
that which is bounded by the river Euphrates, and which
extends to our own inland sea, while the other two parts
which lie between the river Euphrates and the Indus will
scarcely bear comparison with India even if both were
taken together. They also say that India is bounded
towards the east and the east wind as far as the south
by the Great Sea, and towards the north by Mount
Kaukasos, as far as its junction with the Tauros, while
the river Indus cuts it off from other countries towards
the west and the north-west wind as far as the Great Sea.
The larger portion of India is a plain, and this, as they
conjecture, has been formed from the alluvial deposits of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the rivers, just as in other countries plains which are not
far off from the sea are generally formations of their
respective rivers, a fact which explains why the names of
such countries were applied of old to their rivers. There
is, for instance, in the country of Asia the plain of the
Hermos, a river which rises in the mountain of Mother
Dindymênê, and on its way to the sea flows past the
Aiolian city of Smyrna. There is again another Lydian
plain, called that of the Kaÿstros, which is a Lydian
river, and another plain in Mysia, that of the Kaïkos,
and another in Karia, that of the Maiandros, which extends
as far as the Ionian city of Milêtos. In the case of Egypt
again, the two historians, Herodotos, and Hêkataios (or
at any rate the author of the work on Egypt, if he was
other than Hêkataios) agree in declaring that in the same
way Egypt was the gift of its river,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and clear proofs
have been adduced by Herodotos in support of this view,
so that even the country itself got perhaps its name from
the river, for that in early times Aigyptos was the name
of the river which the Egyptians and other nations now
call the Nile the words of Homer sufficiently prove, since
he says<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> that Menelaös anchored his ships at the mouth
of the river Aigyptos. Now if the rivers we have mentioned,
which are of no great size, can each of them
separately form in its course to the sea a large tract of
new country, by carrying down silt and slime from the
upland districts in which they have their sources, there
can be no good reason for doubting that India is mostly
a plain which has been formed by the alluvial deposits of
its rivers.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> For if the Hermos and the Kaÿstros and
the Kaïkos and the Maiandros and the other rivers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Asia which fall into the inland sea were united, they
could not be compared in volume of water with one of
the Indian rivers, and much less with the Ganges, which
is the greatest of them all, and with which neither the
volume of the Egyptian Nile, nor the Istros (Danube)
which flows through Europe, can be for a moment compared.
Nay, the whole of those rivers if combined into
one would not be equal to the Indus, which is already
a large river where it issues from its springs, and which
after receiving as tributaries fifteen rivers,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> all greater than
those of Asia, enters the sea still retaining its own name.
Let these remarks which I have made about the country
of the Indians suffice for the present, while I reserve all
other particulars for my description of India.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter VII.—The bridging of rivers</i></h5>

<p>In what manner Alexander made his bridge over the
Indus neither Aristoboulos nor Ptolemy, the authorities
whom I chiefly follow, have given any account; nor can
I decide for certain whether the passage was bridged with
boats, as was the Hellespont by Xerxes and as were the
Bosporos and the Istros by Darius,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> or whether the bridge
he made over the river was one continuous piece of work.
I incline, however, to think that the bridge must have
been made of boats,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> for neither would the depth of the
river have admitted the construction of an ordinary kind
of bridge, nor could a work so vast and difficult have been
executed in so short a time. But if the passage was
bridged with boats I cannot decide whether the vessels
being fastened together with cables and anchored in a
row sufficed to form a bridge as did those by which, as
Herodotos the Halikarnassian says, the Hellespont was
joined, or whether the method was that which is used by
the Romans in bridging the Istros and the Keltic Rhine,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
and by which they bridged the Euphrates and the Tigris
as often as necessity required. Since, however, the
Romans, as far as my knowledge goes, have found that
the bridging of rivers by boats is the most expeditious
method of crossing them, I think it worth a description
here. The vessels at a preconcerted signal are let go
from their moorings and rowed down stream not prow but
stern foremost. The current of course carries them downward,
but a small pinnace furnished with oars holds
them back till they settle into their appointed place.
Then baskets of wicker work, pyramid-shaped and filled
with rough stones, are lowered into the river from the
prow of each vessel to make it hold fast against the force
of the current. As soon as one of those vessels has been
held fast another is in the same way anchored with its
prow against the stream as far from the first as is commensurate
with their bearing the strain of what is put
upon them. On both of them beams of wood are rapidly
laid lengthwise, and on these again planks are placed
crosswise to bind them together. In this manner the
work proceeds through all the vessels which are required
for bridging the passage. At each end of the structure
firmly fixed railed gangways are thrown forward to the
shore so that horses and beasts of burden may with the
greater safety enter upon it. These gangways serve at
the same time to bind the bridge to the shore. In a
short time the whole is completed amid great noise and
bustle, though discipline is by no means lost sight of as
the work proceeds. In each vessel the occasional exhortations
of the overseers and their rebukes of negligence
neither prevent orders from being heard nor the work
from being quickly executed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter VIII.—Alexander arrives at Taxila—Receives an
embassy from Abisares and advances to the Hydaspês</i></h5>

<p>This method has been practised by the Romans from
of old, but how Alexander bridged the river Indus I
cannot say, for even those who served in his army are
silent on the matter. But the bridge was made, I should
think, as nearly as possible in the way described, or if it
was otherwise contrived let it be so.</p>

<p>When Alexander had crossed to the other side of the
Indus he again offered sacrifice according to his custom.
Then marching away from the Indus he arrived at Taxila,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
a great and flourishing city, the greatest indeed of all the
cities which lay between the river Indus and the Hydaspês.
Taxilês, the governor of the city, and the Indians
who belonged to it received him in a friendly manner,
and he therefore added as much of the adjacent country
to their territory as they requested. While he was there
Abisarês, the king of the Indians of the hill-country, sent
him an embassy which included his own brother and other
grandees of his court. Envoys came also from Doxarês,
the chief of the province, and those like the others brought
presents. Here again in Taxila Alexander offered his
customary sacrifices and celebrated a gymnastic and
equestrian contest. Having appointed Philip, the son of
Makhatas, satrap of the Indians of that district, he left a
garrison in Taxila and those soldiers who were invalided,
and then moved on towards the river Hydaspês—for he
had learned that Pôros with the whole of his army lay on
the other side of that river resolved either to prevent him
from making the passage or to attack him when crossing.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Upon learning this Alexander sent back Koinos, the son
of Polemokratês, to the river Indus with orders to cut in
pieces all the boats that had been constructed for the
passage of the Indus and to bring them to the river
Hydaspês. In accordance with these orders the smaller
boats were cut each into two sections and the thirty-oared
galleys into three, and the sections were then transported
on waggons to the banks of the Hydaspês. There the
boats were reconstructed, and appeared as a flotilla upon
that river. Alexander then taking the forces which he
had with him when he arrived at Taxila and 5000 of the
Indians commanded by Taxilês and the chiefs of that
country advanced towards the Hydaspês.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter IX.—Alexander on reaching the Hydaspês finds
Pôros prepared to dispute its passage</i></h5>

<p>Alexander encamped on the banks of the river,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and
Pôros was seen on the opposite side, with all his army
and his array of elephants around him.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Against the
place where he saw Alexander had encamped, he
remained himself to guard the passage, but he sent
detachments of his men, each commanded by a captain,
to guard all parts of the river where it could be easily
forded, as he was resolved to prevent the Macedonians
from effecting a landing. When Alexander saw this, he
thought it expedient to move his army from place to
place, so that Pôros might be at a loss to discover his real
intentions. For this purpose he divided his army into
many parts, and some of the troops he led himself in
different directions, sometimes to ravage the enemy’s
country, and sometimes to find out where he could most
easily ford the river. He placed various commanders at
various times over different divisions of his army, and
despatched them also in different directions. At the
same time he caused provisions to be conveyed to the
camp from all parts of the country on this side of the
river, to impress Pôros with the conviction that he
intended to remain where he was near the bank, till
the waters of the river subsided in winter, and afforded
him a large choice of passages. As the boats were
constantly plying up and down the stream, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
skins were being filled with hay, while all the bank was
lined, here with horse and there with foot, all this
prevented Pôros from resting and concentrating his
preparations at any one point selected in preference to
any other as the best for defending the passage. At
this time of the year besides, all the Indian rivers were
swollen and flowing with turbid and rapid currents, for
the sun is then wont to turn towards the summer tropic.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
At this season incessant rains deluge the soil of India,
and the snows of the Kaukasos then melting flood the
numerous rivers to which they give birth. In winter
they again subside and become small and clear, and
in many places fordable, with the exception of the
Indus and the Ganges, and perhaps some one or two
others. The Hydaspês at all events does become
fordable.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter X.—Alexander’s devices to deceive Pôros and
steal the passage of the river</i></h5>

<p>Alexander therefore publicly announced that he
would remain where he was throughout that season of
the year if his passage was for the present to be
obstructed, but he continued as before waiting in ambush
to see whether he could anywhere rapidly steal a passage
to the other side without being observed. He clearly
saw that it was impossible for him to cross where Pôros
himself had encamped near the bank of the Hydaspês,
not only because he had so many elephants, but also
because his large army arrayed for battle, and splendidly
accoutred, was ready to attack his troops the moment they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
landed. He foresaw besides that his horses would refuse
to mount the opposite bank, where the elephants would
at once encounter them, and by their very aspect and
their roaring would terrify them outright; nor did he
think that even before they gained the shore they would
remain upon the inflated hides during the passage; but
that on seeing the elephants even at a distance off, they
would become frantic and leap into the water. He
resolved therefore to steal the passage, and to do this in
the following way. Leading out by night the greater
part of his cavalry along the river bank in different
directions, he ordered them to set up a loud clamour,
raise the war-shout,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and fill the shores with every kind
of noise, as if they were really preparing to attempt the
passage. Pôros marched meanwhile along the opposite
bank, in the direction of the noise, having his elephants
with him, and Alexander gradually accustomed him to
lead out his men in this way in opposition. When this
had been done repeatedly, and the men did nothing more
than make a great noise and shout the war-cry, Pôros no
longer made any counter-movement when the cavalry
issued out from the camp, but remained within his own
lines, his spies being, however, posted at numerous points
along the bank. When Alexander had thus quieted the
suspicions of Pôros about his nocturnal attempts, he
devised the following stratagem.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XI.—Arrangements made by Alexander for
crossing the Hydaspês unobserved</i></h5>

<p>There was a bluff ascending from the bank of the
Hydaspês at a point where the river made a remarkable
bend, and this was densely covered with all sorts of trees.
Over against it lay an island in the river overspread with
jungle, an untrodden and solitary place. Perceiving that
this island directly faced the bluff, and that both places<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
were wooded and adapted to screen his attempt to cross
the river, he decided to take his army over this way.
Now the bluff and the island were 150 stadia distant
from the great camp.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> But along the whole of the bank
he had posted running sentries<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> at a proper distance for
keeping each other in sight, and readily transmitting
along the line any orders that might be received from
any quarter. In every direction, moreover, shouts were
raised by night, and fires were burnt for many nights
together. But when he had made up his mind to attempt
the passage, the preparations for crossing were made in
the camp without any concealment. In the camp
Krateros had been left with his own division of the
cavalry, and the Arakhosian and Parapamisadan horsemen,
together with the brigades of the Macedonian
phalanx commanded by Alketas and Polysperchon and
the contingent of 5000 men under the chiefs of the
hither Indians. He had ordered Krateros not to attempt
to cross the river before Pôros moved off against them, or
before learning that he was flying from the field, and
that they were victorious. “If, however,” said he, “Pôros
with one part of his army advances against me while he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
leaves the other part and his elephants in his camp, then
please to remain where you are; but if Pôros takes all
his elephants with him, and a portion of the rest of his
army is left behind in the camp, then do you cross the
river with all possible speed; for,” added he, “it is the
elephants only which make it impossible for the horses to
land on the other bank. The rest of the army can cross
over without difficulty.”</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XII.—Alexander crosses the Hydaspês</i></h5>

<p>Such were the instructions given to Krateros; but
half-way between the island and the main camp in which
he had been left, there were posted Meleager, Attalos and
Gorgias, with the mercenary cavalry and infantry, who
had received orders to cross to the other side in detachments,
into which their ranks were to be separated as soon
as they saw the Indians fairly engaged in battle. He
then selected to be taken under his own command the
corps of body-guards called Companions, the regiments of
cavalry under Hêphaistiôn, Perdikkas and Dêmêtrios, also
the Baktrian, Sogdian, and Skythian cavalry, and the
Daan horse-archers, and from the phalanx of infantry the
hypaspists, the brigade of Kleitos and Koinos, and the
archers and the Agrianians, and with these troops he
marched with secrecy, keeping at a considerable distance
from the bank that he might not be seen to be moving
towards the island and the bluff, from which he intended
to cross over to the other side. There in the night the
skins, which had long before been provided for the purpose,
were stuffed with hay, and securely stitched up. During
the night a violent storm of rain came on, whereby his
preparations and the attempt at crossing were not betrayed
to the enemy by the rattle of arms and the shouting of
orders, since the thunder and rain drowned all other sounds.
Most of the boats which he had ordered to be cut into
sections had been conveyed to this place, and when secretly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
pieced together again were hidden away in the woods
along with the thirty-oared galleys. Towards daybreak the
wind had died down and the rain ceased. The rest of
the army then crossed over in the direction of the island,
the cavalry mounted on the skin pontoon rafts, and as
many of the foot-soldiers as the boats could hold embarked
in them. They so proceeded, that they were not
seen by the sentries posted by Pôros till they had
passed beyond the island, and were not far from the
bank.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XIII.—Incidents of the passage of the river</i></h5>

<p>Alexander himself embarked on a thirty-oared galley,
and went over accompanied by Ptolemy, Perdikkas, and
Lysimachos, his body-guards, and by Seleukos, one of
the companions, who was afterwards king, and by one
half of the hypaspists, the other half being on board of
the other galleys of like size. As soon as the soldiers
had passed beyond the island, they steered for the bank,
being now full in view of the enemy, whose sentinels on
seeing their approach galloped off at the utmost speed of
each man’s horse to carry the tidings to Pôros. Meanwhile
Alexander was himself the first to disembark, and
taking the horsemen who had been conveyed over in his
own and the other thirty-oared galleys, he at once formed
them into line as they kept landing, for the cavalry had
orders to be the first to disembark. At the head of these
duly marshalled he moved forward. Owing, however, to
his ignorance of the locality he had unawares landed not
on the mainland, but upon an island, the great size of
which prevented it all the more from being recognised
as an island. It was separated from the mainland by a
branch of the river in which the water was shallow; but
the violent storm of rain which had lasted the most of
the night had so swollen the stream that the horsemen
could not find the ford, and he feared that the latter part
of the passage would be as laborious as the first. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
at last the ford was found he led his men through it with
difficulty; for the water where deepest reached higher
than the breasts of the foot soldiers, and as for the horses
their heads only were above the river. When he had
crossed this piece of water also, he selected the mounted
corps of body-guards, and the best men from the other
squadrons of cavalry, and brought them from column
into line upon the right wing.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Then in front of all the
cavalry he posted the horse archers, and next in line to
the cavalry and in front of all the infantry the royal
hypaspists commanded by Seleukos. Next to these
again he placed the royal foot guards, and then the
other hypaspists, each in what happened to be the order
of his precedence for the time being. At each extremity
of the phalanx were posted the archers and the Agrianians
and the javelin men.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XIV.—Skirmish with the son of Pôros at the
landing-place</i></h5>

<p>Alexander having made these dispositions, ordered the
infantry, which numbered nearly 6000 men, to follow
him at the ordinary marching pace and in regular order,
for when he saw that he was superior in cavalry, he took
with himself only the horsemen, about 5000 in number,
and led them forward at a rapid pace. Taurôn, the
captain of the archers, he ordered to hasten forward
with his men to give support to the cavalry. He
had come to the conclusion that if Pôros engaged him
with all his troops he would either, without difficulty,
overpower him by charging with his cavalry, or would
remain on the defensive till the infantry came up during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the action, or that if the Indians, terrified by the marvellous
audacity of his passage of the river, should take
to flight, he would be able to pursue them closely, and
the slaughter being thus all the greater there would not
be left much more work for him to do.</p>

<p>Aristoboulos says that the son of Pôros arrived with
about 60 chariots before Alexander made the final passage
from the large island, and that he could have
hindered Alexander from landing (for he made the
passage with difficulty even when no one opposed him),
if the Indians had but leaped down from their chariots
and fallen upon those who first stepped on shore. The
prince, however, passed by with his chariots, and allowed
Alexander to accomplish the passage in complete safety.
Against these Indians Alexander, he says, despatched
his horse archers, who easily put them to a rout which
was by no means bloodless. Other writers say that
while the troops were landing an encounter took place
between the Indians who had come with the son of
Pôros and Alexander at the head of his cavalry, and
that as the son of Pôros had come with a superior force
Alexander himself was wounded by the Indian prince,
and that his favourite horse Boukephalas was killed,
having been wounded, like his master, by the son of
Pôros. But Ptolemy, the son of Lagos, with whom I
agree, gives a different account, for he states, like the
others, that Pôros sent off his son, but not in command
of merely 60 chariots; and indeed it is not at all likely
that Pôros, on learning from the scouts that either Alexander
himself, or, at all events, a part of his army, had
made the passage of the Hydaspês, would have sent his
own son with no more than 60 chariots, which, considered
as a reconnoitring party, would have been too
numerous, and not rapid in retreat, but considered as
meant to repel such of the enemy as had not yet crossed
the river, and to attack those who had already landed, an
altogether inadequate force. He says that the son of
Pôros arrived at the head of 2000 men and 120 chariots,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
and that Alexander had made even the final passage
from the island before the prince appeared upon the
scene.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XV.—The arrangements made by Pôros for the
conflict</i></h5>

<p>Ptolemy states further that Alexander at first despatched
against the prince the horse archers, and led
the cavalry himself, under the belief that Pôros was
advancing against him with the whole of his army, and
that this was a body of advanced cavalry thrown forward
by Pôros. But when he discovered what the real
strength of the Indians was he then briskly charged
them with what cavalry he had with him. When they
noticed that Alexander himself and his body of cavalry
did not charge them in an extended line, but by squadrons,
their ranks gave way, and 400 of their horsemen
fell, and among them the son of Pôros. Their chariots,
moreover, were captured, horses and all, for they proved
heavy in the retreat and useless in the action itself, by
having stuck fast in the clay. When the horsemen who
had escaped from this rout reported one after another to
Pôros that Alexander himself had crossed the river with
the strongest division of his army, and that his son had
been slain in the fight, he was still at a loss what to
determine, for the division which had been left with
Krateros in the great camp right opposite to his own
position appeared to be undertaking the passage, but he
at last decided to march with all his forces against Alexander
and fight it out with the strongest division of the
Macedonians led by the king in person. He nevertheless
left there in his camp a few of the elephants and a small
force to deter the cavalry under the command of Krateros
from landing. He then took all his cavalry, 4000 strong,
all his chariots, 300 in number, 200 of his elephants,
and 30,000 efficient infantry, and marched against Alexander.
When he found a place where he saw there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
no clay, but that the ground from its sandy nature was
all flat and firm, and suited for the movements of cavalry
whether charging or falling back, he then drew up his
army in order of battle,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> posting his elephants in the
front line at intervals of at least 100 feet, so as to have
his elephants ranged in front before the whole body of
his infantry, and so to spread terror at all points among
Alexander’s cavalry. He took it for certain besides that
none of the enemy would have the audacity to push in
at the intervals between the elephants—not the cavalry,
since their horses would be terrified by these animals, and
much less the infantry, since they would be checked in
front by his heavy-armed foot soldiers falling upon them,
and trampled down when the elephants wheeled round
upon them. Behind these he drew up his infantry,
which did not close up in one line with the elephants,
but formed a second line in their rear, so that the
regiments were only partly pushed forward into the
intervals. He had also troops of infantry posted on the
wings beyond the elephants, and on both sides of the
infantry the cavalry had been drawn up, and in front of
it the chariots.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XVI.—The plan of attack adopted by Alexander</i></h5>

<p>In this manner had Pôros arranged his troops. As
soon as Alexander perceived that the Indians had been
drawn up in battle order he made his cavalry halt, that
he might get in hand each regiment of the infantry as it
came up; and even when the phalanx by a rapid march
had effected a junction with the cavalry he still did not
at once marshal its ranks and lead it into action, and
thus expose the men, while tired and out of breath, to
the barbarians, who were quite fresh, but he gave them
time, while he rode round their ranks, to rest until they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
could recover themselves. When he had observed how
the Indians were arranged he made up his mind not to
advance against the centre, in front of which the elephants
had been posted, while the intervals between them had
been filled with compact masses of infantry, for he feared
lest Pôros should reap the advantage which he had calculated
on deriving from that arrangement. But as he
was superior in cavalry he took the greater part of that
force, and marched along towards the left wing of the
enemy to make his attack in this quarter.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Koinos he
sent at the head of his own regiment of horse and that
of Dêmêtrios to the right, and ordered him, when the
barbarians on seeing what a dense mass of cavalry was
opposed to them, should be riding along to encounter it,
to hang close upon their rear.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The command of the
phalanx of infantry he committed to Seleukos, Antigenês,
and Taurôn, who received orders not to take part in the
action till they saw that the phalanx of infantry and the
cavalry of the enemy were thrown into disorder by the
cavalry under his own command.</p>

<p>When the Indians were now within reach of his
missiles he despatched against their left wing the horse
archers, who were 1000 strong, to throw the enemy in
that part of the field into confusion with storms of arrows
and charges of their horses. He marched rapidly forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
himself with the companion cavalry against the left
wing of the barbarians, making haste to attack their
cavalry in a state of disorder while they were still in
column, and before they could deploy into line.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XVII.—Description of the battle of the
Hydaspês—Defeat of Pôros</i></h5>

<p>The Indians meanwhile had collected their horsemen
from every quarter, and were riding forward to repulse
Alexander’s onset, when Koinos, in accordance with his
orders, appeared with his cavalry upon their rear. Seeing
this the Indians had to make their cavalry face both
to front and rear—the largest and best part to oppose
Alexander, and the remainder to wheel round against
Koinos and his squadrons. This therefore at once threw
their ranks into confusion, and disconcerted their plan
of operations; and Alexander, seeing that now was his
opportunity while their cavalry was in the very act of
forming to front and rear, fell upon those opposed to him
with such vigour that the Indians, unable to withstand
the charge of his cavalry, broke from their ranks, and fled
for shelter to the elephants as to a friendly wall.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Upon
this the drivers of the elephants urged these animals forward
against the cavalry; but the Macedonian phalanx
itself now met them face to face, and threw darts at the
men on the elephants, and from one side and the other
struck the elephants themselves as they stood around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
them. This kind of warfare was different from any of
which they had experience in former contests, for the
huge beasts charged the ranks of the infantry, and wherever
they turned went crushing through the Macedonian
phalanx though in close formation; while the horsemen
of the Indians, on seeing that the infantry was now
engaged in the action, again wheeled round and charged
the cavalry. But Alexander’s men, being far superior
in personal strength and military discipline, again routed
them, and again drove them back upon the elephants, and
cooped them up among them. Meanwhile the whole of
Alexander’s cavalry had now been gathered into one
battalion, not in consequence of an order, but from being
thrown together in the course of the struggle, and wherever
they fell upon the ranks of the Indians they made
great carnage before parting from them. The elephants
being now cooped up within a narrow space, did no less
damage to their friends than to their foes, trampling them
under their hoofs as they wheeled and pushed about.
There resulted in consequence a great slaughter of the
cavalry, cooped up as it was in a narrow space around
the elephants. Many of the elephant drivers, moreover,
had been shot down, and of the elephants themselves
some had been wounded, while others, both from exhaustion
and the loss of their mahouts, no longer kept to
their own side in the conflict, but, as if driven frantic by
their sufferings, attacked friend and foe quite indiscriminately,
pushed them, trampled them down, and killed
them in all manner of ways. But the Macedonians, who
had a wide and open field, and could therefore operate as
they thought best, gave way when the elephants charged,
and when they retreated followed at their heels and plied
them with darts; whereas the Indians, who were in the
midst of the animals, suffered far more the effects of their
rage. When the elephants, however, became quite exhausted,
and their attacks were no longer made with
vigour, they fell back like ships backing water, and merely
kept trumpeting as they retreated with their faces to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
enemy. Then did Alexander surround with his cavalry
the whole of the enemy’s line, and signal that the infantry,
with their shields linked together so as to give the utmost
compactness to their ranks, should advance in phalanx.
By this means the cavalry of the Indians was, with a few
exceptions, cut to pieces in the action. Such also was
the fate of the infantry, since the Macedonians were now
pressing upon them from every side. Upon this all
turned to flight wherever a gap could be found in the
cordon of Alexander’s cavalry.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XVIII.—Sequel of the battle and surrender
of Pôros</i></h5>

<p>Meanwhile Krateros and all the other officers of Alexander’s
army, who had been left behind on the opposite
bank of the Hydaspês, crossed the river when they perceived
that Alexander was winning a splendid victory.
These men, being fresh, were employed in the pursuit,
instead of Alexander’s exhausted troops, and they made
no less a slaughter of the Indians in the retreat than had
been made in the engagement.</p>

<p>The loss of the Indians in killed fell little short of
20,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry, and all their chariots
were broken to pieces.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Two sons of Pôros fell in the
battle, and also Spitakês,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> the chief of the Indians of that
district. The drivers of the elephants and of the chariots
were also slain and the cavalry officers and the generals
in the army of Pôros all....<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The elephants, moreover,
that escaped destruction in the field were all captured.
On Alexander’s side there fell about 80 of the 6000 infantry
who had taken part in the first attack, 10 of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
horse archers who first began the action, 20 of the companion
cavalry, and 200 of the other cavalry.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>When Pôros, who had nobly discharged his duties
throughout the battle, performing the part not only of a
general, but also that of a gallant soldier, saw the slaughter
of his cavalry and some of his elephants lying dead, and
others wandering about sad and sullen without their
drivers, while the greater part of his infantry had been
killed, he did not, after the manner of Darius, the great
king, abandon the field and show his men the first example
of flight, but, on the contrary, fought on as long as
he saw any Indians maintaining the contest in a united
body; but he wheeled round on being wounded in the
right shoulder, where only he was unprotected by armour
in the battle. All the rest of his person was rendered
shot-proof by his coat of mail, which was remarkable for
its strength and the closeness with which it fitted his
person, as could afterwards be observed by those who saw
him. When he found himself wounded he turned his
elephant round and began to retire. Alexander, perceiving
that he was a great man and valiant in fight, was
anxious to save his life, and for this purpose sent to him
first of all Taxilês the Indian. Taxilês, who was on
horseback, approached as near the elephant which carried
Pôros as seemed safe, and entreated him, since it was no
longer possible for him to flee, to stop his elephant and
listen to the message he brought from Alexander. But
Pôros, on finding that the speaker was his old enemy
Taxilês, turned round and prepared to smite him with
his javelin; and he would probably have killed him
had not Taxilês instantly put his horse to the gallop
and got beyond the reach of Pôros. But not even for
this act did Alexander feel any resentment against Pôros,
but sent to him messenger after messenger, and last of all
Meroês, an Indian, as he had learned that Pôros and this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Meroês were old friends. As soon as Pôros heard the
message which Meroês now brought just at a time when
he was overpowered by thirst, he made his elephant halt
and dismounted. Then, when he had taken a draught of
water and felt revived, he requested Meroês to conduct
him without delay to Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter XIX.—Alexander makes Pôros his firm friend
and ally—Founds two cities—Death of his famous
horse Boukephalas</i></h5>

<p>He was then conducted to Alexander, who, on learning
that Meroês was approaching with him, rode forward
in front of his line with a few of the Companions to meet
him. Then reining in his horse he beheld with admiration
the handsome person and majestic stature of Pôros,
which somewhat exceeded five cubits. He saw, too,
with wonder that he did not seem to be broken and
abased in spirit, but that he advanced to meet him as a
brave man would meet another brave man after gallantly
contending with another king in defence of his kingdom.
Then Alexander, who was the first to speak, requested
Pôros to say how he wished to be treated. The report
goes that Pôros said in reply, “Treat me, O Alexander!
as befits a king;” and that Alexander, being pleased with
his answer, replied, “For mine own sake, O Pôros! thou
shalt be so treated, but do thou, in thine own behalf, ask
for whatever boon thou pleasest,” to which Pôros replied
that in what he had asked everything was included.
Alexander was more delighted than ever with this rejoinder,
and not only appointed Pôros to govern his own
Indians, but added to his original territory another of still
greater extent. Alexander thus treated this brave man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
as befitted a king, and he consequently found him in all
respects faithful and devoted to his interests. Such, then,
was the result of the battle in which Alexander fought
against Pôros<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and the Indians of the other side of the
Hydaspês in the month of Mounychion of the year when
Hêgemôn was archon in Athens.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Alexander founded two cities, one on the battlefield,
and the other at the point whence he had started to cross
the river Hydaspês. The former he called Nikaia in
honour of his victory over the Indians, and the other
Boukephala<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> in memory of his horse Boukephalas, which
died there, not from being wounded by any one, but from
toil and old age, for he was about thirty years old,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and
had heretofore undergone many toils and dangers along
with Alexander. This Boukephalas was never mounted
by any one except Alexander only, for he disdained all
other riders. He was of an uncommon size and of
generous mettle. He had by way of a distinguishing
mark the head of an ox impressed upon him, and some
say that from this circumstance he got his name. But
others say that though he was black, he had on his forehead
a white mark which bore a close resemblance to the
brow of an ox. In the country of the Ouxians this horse
disappeared from Alexander, who sent a proclamation
through the land that he would kill all the Ouxians if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
they did not bring him his horse, and brought back he
was immediately after the proclamation had been issued<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>—so
great was Alexander’s attachment to his favourite, and
so great was the fear of Alexander which prevailed among
the barbarians. Let so much honour be paid by me to
this Boukephalas for Alexander’s sake.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XX.—Alexander conquers the Glausai, receives
embassies from Abisarês and other chiefs, and crosses
the Akesinês</i></h5>

<p>When Alexander had duly honoured with splendid
obsequies those who had been slain in the battle, he
offered to the gods in acknowledgment of his victory the
customary sacrifices, and celebrated athletic and equestrian
contests on the bank of the river Hydaspês, at the place
where he first crossed with his army. He then left
Krateros behind with a part of the army to build and
fortify the cities which he was founding there, while he
advanced himself against the Indians whose country lay
next to the dominions of Pôros. Aristoboulos says that
the name of the nation was the Glaukanikoi, but Ptolemy
calls them the Glausai.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> By which of the names it was
called I take to be a matter of no consequence. Alexander
invaded their country with the half of the companion
cavalry, picked men from each phalanx of the infantry,
all the horse-archers, the Agrianians, and the other archers.
The people everywhere surrendered on terms of capitulation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
In this manner he took seven-and-thirty cities, the
smallest of which contained not fewer than 5000 inhabitants,
while many contained upwards of 10,000. He
took also a great many villages which were not less
populous than the towns; and this country he gave to
Pôros to rule,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and between him and Taxilês he effected a
reconciliation. He then sent Taxilês home to his capital.</p>

<p>At this time envoys came from Abisarês to say that
their king surrendered himself and his whole realm to
Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Yet before the battle in which Alexander
had defeated Pôros, Abisarês was ready with his army to
fight on the side of Pôros. But he now sent his brother
along with the other envoys to Alexander, taking with
them money and forty elephants as a present. Envoys
also arrived from the independent Indians, and from
another Indian ruler called Pôros.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Alexander ordered
Abisarês to come to him as quickly as possible, threatening
that if he did not come he would see him and his
army arriving where he would not rejoice to see them.</p>

<p>At this time Phratophernes, the satrap of Parthia and
Hyrkania, at the head of the Thracians who had been
left with him came to Alexander. There came also
envoys from Sisikottos, the satrap of the Assakênians,
reporting that these people had slain their governor and
revolted from Alexander. Against these he sent Philippos
and Tyriaspês to quell the insurrection and restore
tranquillity and order to the province.</p>

<p>Alexander himself advanced towards the river Akesinês.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
This is the only Indian river of which Ptolemy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
the son of Lagos, has mentioned the size. He states that
where Alexander crossed it with his army in boats and
on inflated hides the current was so rapid that the waters
dashed with foam and fury against the large and jagged
rocks with which the channel was bestrewn. He informs
us also that it was 15 stadia in breadth; and while the
passage was easy for those who crossed upon inflated
hides, not a few of those who were carried in boats perished
in the waters, as many of the boats were dashed to
pieces by striking against the rocks. From this description
we may fairly conclude, if we institute a comparison,
that the size of the river Indus has been pretty correctly
stated by those who take it to have an average breadth of
40 stadia, while, where narrowest and of course deepest,
it contracts to a breadth of 15 stadia, which I take to be
its actual breadth in many parts of its course, for I conclude
that Alexander selected a part of the Akesinês
where the passage was widest, and where the current
would consequently be slower than elsewhere.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXI.—Pursuit after Pôros, nephew of the great
Pôros—Conquest of the country between the Akesinês
and the Hydraôtês—Passage of the latter river</i></h5>

<p>After crossing the river he left Koinos there upon the
bank with his own brigade, and ordered him to superintend
the passage of the river by those troops which had
been left behind to collect corn and other supplies from
the part of India which was now under his authority.
Pôros he sent home to his capital with orders to select
the best fighting men of the Indians, and to muster all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
the elephants he possessed, and to rejoin him with these.
He resolved to pursue in person the other Pôros—the
bad one—with the lightest troops in his army, for word
had been brought that he had fled from the country of
which he was the ruler; for, while hostilities still subsisted
between Alexander and the other Pôros, this Pôros
had sent envoys to Alexander offering to surrender into
his hands both his person and the country over which he
ruled, but this more from enmity to Pôros than friendliness
to Alexander. On learning therefore that Pôros had
not only been set at liberty, but had his kingdom restored
to him, and that too with a large accession of territory, he
was overcome with fear, not so much of Alexander as of
his namesake Pôros, and fled from his country, taking
with him as many fighting men as he could persuade to
accompany him in his flight.</p>

<p>Alexander, while marching to overtake him, arrived at
the Hydraôtês—another Indian river, not less in breadth
than the Akesinês, but not so rapid.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Over all the
country which he overran he planted garrisons in the most
suitable places, so that the troops under Krateros and
Koinos might, while scouring it far and near for forage,
traverse it in safety to join him. He then despatched
Hêphaistiôn with a force comprising two divisions of
infantry, his own regiment of cavalry and that of Dêmêtrios,
and one-half of the archers, into the country of that
Pôros who had revolted. He received orders to hand over
the country to the other Pôros, and when he had reduced
all the independent Indian tribes bordering on the banks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
of the Hydraôtês, to place these also under the rule of
Pôros. He himself then crossed the river Hydraôtês,
where he met with none of the difficulties which had
attended the passage of the Akesinês. When he was
advancing into the country beyond the Hydraôtês he
found most of the natives willing to surrender on capitulation,
while some met him in arms, and others were
captured when attempting to escape and reduced to
submission.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXII.—Alexander marches against the Kathaians—Takes
Pimprama, and lays siege to Sangala</i></h5>

<p>Alexander meanwhile had learned that the Kathaians<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
and other tribes of independent Indians<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> were preparing to
meet him in battle if he invaded their country, and were
inviting the neighbouring tribes, which were independent
like themselves, to coöperate with them. He learned also
that the city near which they meant to engage him was
strongly fortified, and was called Sangala.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The Kathaians
themselves enjoyed the highest reputation for courage
and skill in the art of war, and the same warlike spirit
characterised the Oxydrakai, another Indian race, and
the Malloi, who were also an Indian race, for when
shortly before this time Pôros and Abisarês had marched
against them with their armies, and had besides stirred
up many of the independent Indians against them, they
were obliged, as it turned out, to retreat without accomplishing
anything at all adequate to the scale of their
preparations.</p>

<p>Alexander, on receiving this intelligence, marched
rapidly against the Kathaians, and on the second day
after he had left the river Hydraôtês arrived at a city<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
named Pimprama, belonging to an Indian race called the
Adraïstai,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> which surrendered on terms of capitulation.
Alexander gave his troops rest the next day, and on the
third day advanced to Sangala, where the Kathaians and
the neighbouring tribes that had joined them were mustered
before the city, and drawn up in battle-order on a
low hill, which was not on all sides precipitous. They
lay encamped behind their waggons, which, by encircling
the hill in three rows, protected the camp with a triple
barricade. Alexander, on perceiving the great number of
the barbarians, and the nature of the position they occupied,
drew up his army in the order which seemed best
suited to the circumstances, and at once despatched
against them the horse-archers just as they were, with
orders to ride along and shoot at the Indians from a distance,
so as not only to prevent them from making a
sortie before his own dispositions should be completed,
but to wound them within their stronghold even before
the battle began. Upon his right wing he posted
the corps of horseguards and the cavalry regiment of
Kleitos, next to these the hypaspists, and then the
Agrianians. The left wing he assigned to Perdikkas,
who commanded his own cavalry regiment and the battalions
of the footguards. The archers he formed into
two bodies, and placed them upon each wing. While he
was making these dispositions the infantry and cavalry
which formed the rearguard arrived upon the field. This
cavalry he divided in two parts, and led one to each wing,
and with the infantry that had arrived he closed up the
ranks of the phalanx more densely. Then he took the
cavalry which had been drawn up on the right and
advanced against the waggons ranged on the left wing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
of the Indians, where the position seemed easier to
assault, and where the waggons were not so closely
packed together.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXIII.—Alexander drives the Kathaians into
Sangala, which he invests on every side</i></h5>

<p>But when the Indians, instead of sallying out from
behind their waggons to attack the cavalry as it advanced,
mounted upon them, and began to shoot from the top of
them, Alexander saw that this was not work for cavalry,
and so, having dismounted, he led on foot the phalanx
of infantry against them. The Macedonians found no
difficulty in driving the Indians from the first row of
waggons, but on the other hand the Indians, having
formed in line in front of the second row, were able to
force back their assailants with greater ease, standing as
they did more compactly together, and in a narrower
circle, while the Macedonians had less room in which to
operate against them. At this time they quietly drew
back the waggons of the first row, and through the gaps
each man, as he found an opportunity, assailed the enemy
in an irregular way.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Yet even from these waggons they
were forcibly driven by the phalanx of infantry, and even
at the third row they no longer held ground, but fled
with all the haste they could into the city and shut themselves
up within its gates. Alexander that same day
encamped with his infantry around the city, as far at least
as the phalanx enabled him to surround it, for the wall
was of such great extent that his camp did not completely
environ it. Opposite the part where the gap was
left, and where also was a lake not far from the walls, he
posted the cavalry all round the lake, as he knew it not
to be deep, and at the same time anticipated that the
Indians, terrified by their previous defeat, would abandon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
the city during the night. The event showed he had conjectured
aright, for about the second watch the most of
them dropped down from the wall and came upon the
outposts of the cavalry. The foremost of them were cut
to pieces by the sentinels, but those in the rear, perceiving
that the lake was guarded all round, withdrew into the
city. Alexander now encompassed the city with a double
stockade, except where the lake shut it in, and around
the lake he posted guards to keep still stricter watch. He
resolved also to bring up the military engines against the
place for battering down the walls. Some deserters, however,
came to him from the city and informed him that
the Indians intended that very night to escape from the
city by way of the lake where the gap occurred in the
stockade. So at that point he stationed Ptolemy, the
son of Lagos, with three divisions of the hypaspists, each
1000 strong, all the Agrianians, and a single line of
archers, and pointed out to him the particular spot where
the barbarians, as he conjectured, were likeliest to attempt
forcing their passage. “And now,” said he, “when thou
perceivest the barbarians forcing their way at this point,
do thou with the army arrest their advance, and order the
trumpets to sound the signal; and do you, sirs,” he added,
turning to the officers, “as soon as the signal is given,
each of you with your men in battle-order, hasten towards
the noise wherever the trumpet summons you. I shall
not myself stand idly by away from the broil.”</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXIV.—Alexander captures Sangala, razes it to
the ground, and advances to the river Hyphasis</i></h5>

<p>Such were the directions he gave, and Ptolemy in that
place collected as many as he could of the waggons which
the enemy had left behind in their first flight, and placed
them athwart so that the fugitives might imagine there
were many obstacles to their escaping by night. He
ordered the stakes, which had been cut but not fixed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
the ground, to be formed into stockades at different points
between the lake and the wall. All this was done by
the soldiers during the night. But when it was now
about the fourth watch the barbarians, in accordance with
the information Alexander had received, opened the gates
which fronted the lake and rushed towards it at full
speed. They did not, however, escape the vigilance either
of the picquets posted there, or of Ptolemy who lay behind
ready to support them; and just then the trumpeters
gave him the signal, and he advanced against the barbarians
with his troops which were under arms and drawn up
ready for action. The waggons, moreover, as well as the
stockade, which had been constructed between the wall
and the lake, impeded the fugitives; and as soon as the
trumpet sounded the alarm Ptolemy with his men fell
upon them and killed them, one after another, as they
slunk out from the waggons. Upon this the Indians fled
back once more to the city for refuge, and as many as
500 of them were slain in the retreat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pôros also arrived, bringing with him the
remainder of his elephants and a force of 5000 Indians,
and the military engines which had been constructed by
Alexander were now being brought up to the wall. But
the Macedonians, before any part of it was battered down,
took the city by storm, having undermined the wall,
which was of brick, and planted ladders against it all
round. In the capture 17,000 of the Indians were
slaughtered, and more than 70,000 were captured, together
with 300 waggons and 500 horsemen.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The loss in
Alexander’s army during all the siege was somewhat
under 100 killed, but the proportion of the wounded to
the number killed was higher than usual, for there were
1200 wounded, including some officers, and among these
Lysimachos, a member of the body-guard.</p>

custom, sent Eumenês, his secretary, in command of 300<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
horsemen to the two cities which had revolted along with
Sangala, to tell those who held them that Sangala had been
captured, and that Alexander would not at all deal hardly
with them if they remained where they were and received
him in a friendly way, for that none of the independent
Indians who had voluntarily surrendered themselves had
received any ill-treatment at his hands. But they had
already learned that Sangala had been stormed by Alexander,
and being terrified by the news had left the cities
and were in flight. When Alexander was informed of
their flight he hastened after them, but as they had a long
start of him most of them baffled his efforts to overtake
them. Those, however, who were left behind in the
retreat when their strength failed were taken by the troops
and slaughtered to the number of about 500. As he
gave up the design of pursuing the fugitives any farther,
he drew back to Sangala and razed the city to the ground.
The land belonging to it he made over to those Indians
who had formerly been independent, but who had voluntarily
submitted to him. He then sent Pôros with his
own forces to the cities which had submitted to introduce
garrisons within them, but he himself with his army
advanced to the river Hyphasis<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> to conquer the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
who dwelt beyond it. Nor did there appear to him any
end of the war as long as an enemy remained to be
encountered.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXV.—Alexander finding the army unwilling to
advance beyond the Hyphasis, convokes his officers and
addresses them on the subject</i></h5>

<p>It was reported that the country beyond the Hyphasis
was exceedingly fertile, and that the inhabitants were
good agriculturists, brave in war, and living under an
excellent system of internal government; for the multitude
was governed by the aristocracy, who exercised their
authority with justice and moderation. It was also
reported that the people there had a greater number of
elephants than the other Indians, and that those were
of superior size and courage. This information only
whetted Alexander’s eagerness to advance farther, but
the Macedonians now began to lose heart when they
saw the king raising up without end toils upon toils and
dangers upon dangers. The army, therefore, began to
hold conferences at which the more moderate men bewailed
their condition, while others positively asserted
that they would follow no farther though Alexander himself
should lead the way. When this came to Alexander’s
knowledge he convoked the officers in command of
brigades, before the disorder and despondency should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
be further developed among the soldiers, and he thus
addressed them:</p>

<p>“On seeing that you, O Macedonians and allies! no
longer follow me into dangers with your wonted alacrity,
I have summoned you to this assembly that I may either
persuade you to go farther, or be persuaded by you to
turn back. If you have reason to complain of past
labours, and of me your leader, I need say no more. But
if by those labours you have acquired Ionia,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and the
Hellespont with the two Phrygias, Kappadokia, Paphlagonia,
Lydia, Karia, Lykia, and Pamphylia, as well as
Phoenikia and Egypt, together with Hellenic Lybia, part
of Arabia, Hollow Syria, Mesopotamia, Babylon, Sousiana,
Persis, and Media, and all the provinces governed by the
Medes and Persians, not to mention other states which
were never subject to them; if in addition we have
conquered the regions beyond the Kaspian Gates, those
beyond Kaukasos, the Tanais<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> also, and the country
beyond, Baktria, Hyrkania, and the Hyrkanian Sea; if
we have driven the Skythians back into their deserts, and
if besides, the Indus, Hydaspês, Akesinês, and Hydraôtês
flow through territories that are ours, why should you
hesitate to pass the Hyphasis also and add the tribes
beyond it to your Macedonian conquests? Are you
afraid there are other barbarians who may yet successfully
resist you, although of those we have already met some
have willingly submitted, others have been captured in
flight, while others have left us their deserted country to
be distributed either to our allies or to those who have
voluntarily submitted to us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXVI.—Continuation of Alexander’s Speech</i></h5>

<p>“For my part, I think that to a man of spirit there
is no other aim and end of his labours except the labours
themselves, provided they be such as lead him to the
performance of glorious deeds. But if any one wishes
to know the limits of the present warfare, let him understand
that the river Ganges and the Eastern Sea are now
at no great distance off. This sea, I am confident, is
connected with the Hyrkanian Sea, because the Great Ocean
flows round the whole earth.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> I shall besides prove to
the Macedonians and their allies that the Indian Gulf
is connected with the Persian, and the Hyrkanian Sea
with the Indian Gulf. From the Persian Gulf our fleet
will sail round to Lybia as far as the Pillars of Heraklês.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
From these pillars all the interior of Lybia becomes ours,
and thus all Asia shall belong to us,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and the boundaries
of our empire in that direction will coincide with those
which the deity has made the boundaries of the earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
But, if we now turn back, many warlike nations extending
beyond the Hyphasis to the Eastern Sea, and many others
lying northwards between these and Hyrkania, to say
nothing of their neighbours the Skythian tribes, will be
left behind us unconquered, so that if we turn back
there is cause to fear lest the conquered nations, as
yet wavering in their fidelity, may be instigated to revolt
by those who are still independent. Our many labours
will in that case be all completely thrown away, or we
must enter on a new round of toils and dangers. But
persevere, O Macedonians and allies! glory crowns the
deeds of those who expose themselves to toils and
dangers. Life, signalised by deeds of valour, is delightful,
and so is death, if we leave behind us an immortal
name. Know ye not that it was not by staying at home
in Tiryns<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> or Argos, or even in Peloponnêsos or Thebes,
that our ancestor was exalted to such glory, that from
being a man he became, or was thought to be, a god.
Nor were the labours few even of Dionysos, who ranks
as a god far above Heraklês. But we have advanced
beyond Nysa, and the rock Aornos, which proved impregnable
to Heraklês, is in our possession. Add, then, the
rest of Asia to our present acquisitions—the smaller part
of it to the greater. Could we ourselves, think you, have
achieved any great and memorable deeds if, sitting down
at home in Macedonia, we had been content without
exertion merely to preserve our own country, by repelling
the attacks of the neighbouring Thracians, Illyrians, and
Triballians, or those Greeks whose disposition to us is
unfriendly?</p>

<p>“If, indeed, while leading you, I had myself shrunk from
the toils and dangers to which you were exposed, you
would not without good reason be dispirited in prospect
of undertaking fresh enterprises, seeing that while you
alone shared the toils, it was for others you procured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
the rewards. But our labours are in common; I, equally
with you, share in the dangers, and the rewards become
the public property. For the land is yours, and you
are its satraps; and among you the greater part of its
treasures has already been distributed. And when all
Asia is subdued then, by heaven, I will not merely satisfy,
but exceed every man’s hopes and wishes. Such of you
as wish to return home I shall send back to your own
country, or even myself will lead you back. But those
who remain here I will make objects of envy to those
who go back.”</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXVII—Koinos, replying to Alexander, states
the grievances of the army</i></h5>

<p>When Alexander had spoken to this and the like
effect, a long silence followed, because those present neither
dared to speak freely in opposition to the king, nor yet
wished to assent to what he proposed. Alexander again
and again requested that any one who wished should
speak, even if his views differed from those which he
had himself expressed. But the silence was unbroken
for a long time, till at last Koinos, the son of Polemokratês,
summoned up courage and spoke to this effect:</p>

<p>“Forasmuch as you do not wish, O king! to rule
Macedonians by constraint, but say that you will lead
them by persuasion, or suffering yourself to be persuaded
by them, will not have recourse to compulsion, I intend
to speak, not on behalf of myself and fellow-officers who
have been honoured above the other soldiers, and have
most of us received splendid rewards of our labours,
and from having been highly exalted above others are
more zealous than others to serve you in all things, but
in behalf of the great body of the army. Yet on behalf
of this army I intend not to say what may be agreeable
to the men, but what I think will be conducive to your
present interests and safest for the future. I feel bound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
by my age not to conceal what appears to be the best
course to follow; bound by the high authority conferred
on me by yourself, and bound also by the unhesitating
boldness which I have hitherto exhibited in all enterprises
of danger. The more I look to the number and magnitude
of the exploits performed under your command by
us who set out with you from home, the more does it
seem to me expedient to place some limit to our toils
and dangers. For you see yourself how many Macedonians
and Greeks started with you, and how few of us are left.
From our ranks you sent away home from Baktra the
Thessalians<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> as soon as you saw they had no stomach
for further toils, and in this you acted wisely. Of the
other Greeks, some have been settled in the cities founded
by you, where all of them are not willing residents;
others still share our toils and dangers. They and the
Macedonian army have lost some of their numbers in
the fields of battle; others have been disabled by wounds;
others have been left behind in different parts of Asia,
but the majority have perished by disease. A few only
out of many survive, and these few possessed no longer
of the same bodily strength as before, while their spirits
are still more depressed.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> All those, whose parents are
still living, have a yearning to see them—a yearning
to see their wives and children—a yearning to see were
it but their native land itself—a desire pardonable in
men who would return home in great splendour derived
from your munificence, and raised from humble to high
rank, and from indigence to wealth. Seek not, therefore,
to lead them against their inclinations, for you will not
find them the same men in the face of dangers, if they
enter without heart into their contests with the enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
But do you also, if it agree with your wishes, return
home with us, see your mother once more, settle the
affairs of the Greeks, and carry to the house of your
fathers those your great and numerous victories. Then
having so done, form, if you so wish, a fresh expedition
against these same tribes of eastern Indians, or, if you
prefer, against the shores of the Euxine Sea, or against
Karchêdon,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and the parts of Lybia beyond the Karchêdonians.
It will then be your part to unfold your
purpose, and then other Macedonians and other Greeks
will follow you—young men full of vigour instead of old
men worn out with toils—men for whom war, through
their inexperience of it, has no immediate terrors, and
eager to set out from the hope of future rewards. They
will also naturally follow you with the greater alacrity,
from seeing that the companions of your former toils
and dangers have returned home wealthy instead of
poor, and raised to high distinction from their original
obscurity. Moderation, in the midst of success, is, O
king! the noblest of virtues, for though, at the head of
so brave an army, you have nothing to dread from mortal
foes, yet the visitations of the deity cannot be foreseen,
and man cannot, therefore, guard against them.”</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXVIII.—Alexander mortified by the refusal of his
army to advance, secludes himself in his tent, but in
the end resolves to return</i></h5>

<p>When Koinos had concluded his address, those present
are said to have signified their approval of what he said
by loud applause, while many by their streaming tears
showed still more expressively their aversion to encounter
further dangers, and how welcome to them was the idea
of returning. But Alexander, who resented the freedom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
with which Koinos had spoken, and the hesitation displayed
by the other generals, broke up the conference; but next
day while his wrath was still hot he summoned the same
men again, and told them that he was going forward himself,
but would not force any of the Macedonians to
accompany him against their wishes, for he would find
men ready to follow their king of their own free will.
But those who wished to go away were free to go home,
and might tell their friends there that they had returned,
and left their king in the midst of his enemies. It is said
that with these words he withdrew into his tent, and did
not admit any of his companions to see him on that day,
nor even till the third day after, waiting to see whether a
change of mood, such as often takes place in an assemblage
of soldiers, would manifest itself among the Macedonians
and the allies, and make them readier to yield to his
persuasions. But when a deep silence again reigned
throughout the camp, and the soldiers were evidently
offended by his wrath without their minds being changed
by it, he began none the less, as Ptolemy, the son of Lagos,
states, to offer there sacrifice for the passage of the river;
but when on sacrificing he found the omens were against
him, he then assembled the oldest of the Companions, and
especially his intimate friends among them, and as everything
indicated that to return was his most expedient
course he intimated to the army that he had resolved to
march back.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXIX.—Alexander erects altars on the banks of the
Hyphasis to mark the limits of his advance, recrosses
the Hydraôtês and Akesinês and regains the Hydaspês</i></h5>

<p>Then they shouted, as a mixed multitude would shout
when rejoicing, and many of them shed tears. Some of
them even approached the royal pavilion, and invoked
many blessings on Alexander, because by them and them
only did he permit himself to be vanquished. He then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
divided the army into brigades, which he ordered to
prepare twelve altars<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> to equal in height the highest
military towers, and to exceed them in point of breadth, to
serve as thank-offerings to the gods who had led him so
far as a conqueror, and also as a memorial of his own
labours. When the altars had been constructed, he offered
sacrifice upon them with the customary rites, and celebrated
a gymnastic and equestrian contest. Having
thereafter committed all the country west of the river
Hyphasis to the government of Pôros, he marched back
to the Hydraôtês. After crossing this river, he retraced
his steps to the Akesinês, and on arriving there found
the city which he had ordered Hêphaistiôn to fortify
completely built.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Herein he settled as many of the inhabitants
of the neighbourhood as were willing to make
it their domicile, and such also of the mercenary soldiers
as were now unfit for further service. He then began
to make preparations for the downward voyage to the
Great Sea.</p>

<p>At this time Arsakês,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> ruler of the country adjoining
the dominions of Abisarês, together with the brother of
Abisarês and his other relatives, came to him, bringing
presents such as the Indians consider the most valuable,
and some thirty elephants sent by Abisarês. They represented
that Abisarês was prevented from coming in
person by illness—a statement which the ambassadors
sent by Alexander to Abisarês corroborated. Alexander,
readily believing that such was the case, made Abisarês
satrap of his own dominions, and moreover placed Arsakês
under his jurisdiction. Having then fixed the amount which
was to be paid as tribute, he again offered sacrifice near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
the river Akesinês. He then recrossed that river, and
reached the Hydaspês, where he employed his army in
repairing the damage caused by the rains to the cities of
Nikaia and Boukephala, and set the other affairs of the
country in order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sixth Book</span></h4>

<h5><i>Chapter I.—Alexander mistakes the Indus for the upper
Nile—Prepares to sail down stream to the sea</i></h5>

<p>When Alexander had got ready upon the banks of the
Hydaspês a large number of thirty-oared galleys, and
others of one bank and a half of oars, besides numerous
horse transports and every other requisite for the easy
conveyance of an army by river, he resolved to sail down
the Hydaspês<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> to the Great Sea. As he had before this
seen crocodiles in the river Indus, and in no other river
but the Nile only, and had besides seen beans of the same
species as those which Egypt produces<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> growing near the
banks of the Akesinês, and as he had heard that this river
falls into the Indus, he was led to think that he had discovered
the sources of the Nile. His idea was that this
river rose somewhere among the Indians and pursued its
course through a vast tract of desert country, where it lost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
the name of the Indus, and that from the time when it
began to flow through the inhabited parts of the world it
was called the Nile both by the Aithiopians, who lived
there and by the Egyptians, just as Homer also changed
its name, calling it the river Egypt after Egypt, the
country where at last it discharges itself into the Inner
Sea.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Accordingly when he was writing to his mother
Olympias about the country of the Indians, he mentioned,
it is said, among other things that he thought he had discovered
the sources of the Nile, actually basing on such
slight and contemptible evidence his judgements respecting
questions of so much importance. When, however,
he investigated with special care the facts relating to the
river Indus, he ascertained from the natives that the
Hydaspês unites with the Akesinês, and the Akesinês with
the Indus, to which the other two rivers lose both their
waters and their names. He learned further that the
Indus discharges itself into the Great Sea by two mouths,
and that it has no connection with the Egyptian country.
He is said to have then deleted what he had written
about the Nile in the letter to his mother, and as he had
set his mind on sailing down the rivers to the Great Sea
he ordered a fleet for this purpose to be prepared for him.
Adequate crews for the vessels were supplied by the
Phoenicians, Cyprians, Karians, and Egyptians who accompanied
the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter II.—Description of the voyage down the Hydaspês</i></h5>

<p>At this time Koinos, who was one of Alexander’s most
faithful companions, took ill and died, and his master buried
him with all the magnificence circumstances allowed. He
then assembled the Companions and all the ambassadors
of the Indians who had come to him, and in their presence
appointed Pôros king of all the Indian territories already
subjugated—seven nations in all, containing more than
2000 cities. He then made the following distribution of
his army. He took in the ships along with himself all
the hypaspists, and the archers, and the Agrianians, and
the corps of horse-guards.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Krateros commanding a
division of the infantry and cavalry, conducted it along
the right bank of the Hydaspês, while Hêphaistiôn on the
opposite bank advanced in command of the largest and
best division of the army, to which the elephants, now
about 200 in number, were attached. These generals
were instructed to march with all possible speed to where
the palace of Sôpeithês<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> was situated. Philippos, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
satrap of the province lying west of the Indus in the
direction of the Baktrians, received orders to follow them
with his troops after an interval of three days, but the
cavalry of the Nysaians he now sent back to Nysa. The
command of the whole naval squadron was entrusted to
Nearchos, while the pilot of Alexander’s own ship was
Onêsikritos, who, in the narrative which he composed
about the wars of Alexander, among his other lies,
described himself as the commander of the fleet, although
he was in reality only a pilot. According to Ptolemy, the
son of Lagos, whose authority I principally follow, the
ships numbered collectively eighty thirty-oared galleys,
but the whole fleet, including the horse-transports and
the small craft and other river boats consisting of those
that formerly plied on the rivers and those recently built
for the present service, did not fall much short of 2000.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter III.—Description of the voyage down the Hydaspês
continued</i></h5>

<p>When all the preparations had been completed, the
army at break of day began to embark. Alexander himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
sacrificed according to custom both to the gods and
to the river Akesinês as the seers directed. After he had
embarked he poured a libation into the river, from his
station on the prow, out of a golden bowl, and invoked
not only the Hydaspês, but also the Akesinês, as he had
learned that the Akesinês was the greatest of all the
confluents of the Hydaspês, and that their point of junction
was not far off. He invoked likewise the Indus, into
which the Akesinês falls after receiving the Hydaspês.
He further poured out libations to his ancestor Heraklês,
and to Ammôn<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and every other god to whom it was his
custom to sacrifice, and then he ordered the signal for
starting on the voyage to be given by sound of trumpet.
The fleet as soon as the signal sounded began the voyage
in due order, for directions had been given at what distances
the luggage-boats, the horse-transports, and the
war-galleys should keep apart from each other to prevent
collisions which would be inevitable if the ships sailed at
random down the channel. Even the fast sailers were
not allowed to break rank by out-distancing the others.
The noise caused by the rowing was great beyond all
precedent, proceeding as it did from a vast number of
boats being rowed simultaneously, and swelled by the
shouts of the officers directing the rowing to begin or to
stop, commingled with the shouts of the rowers, which rung
like the war-cry when they joined together in keeping
time to the dashing of the oars. The banks, moreover,
being in many places higher than the ships, and compressing
the sound within a narrow compass, sent the echoes,
greatly increased by the compression itself, flying to and
fro between them. The ravines also which occasionally
opened on the river on either of its shores served further
to swell the din by reverberating amid their solitudes the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
thuds of the oars. The appearance of the war-horses on
the decks of the transports struck the barbarians, who saw
them through the lattice work, with such wonder and
astonishment, that the throng which lined the shores to
witness the departure of the fleet accompanied it to a
great distance, for in the country of the Indians horses
had never before been seen on shipboard, nor was there
any tradition to the effect that the Indian expedition of
Dionysos was of a naval character. Those Indians also
who had already submitted to Alexander, as soon as they
heard the shouts of the rowers and the dashing of the
oars, ran down to the edge of the river and followed the
fleet, singing their wild native chaunts, for the Indians have
been peculiarly distinguished among the nations as lovers
of dance and song, ever since Dionysos and his attendant
Bacchanals made their festive progress through the realms
of India.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter IV.—Alexander accelerates his voyage to frustrate
the plans of the Malloi and Oxydrakai, and reaches
the turbulent confluence of the Hydaspês and Akesinês</i></h5>

<p>Alexander sailing thus,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> halted on the third day at the
place where he had ordered Hêphaistiôn and Krateros to
pitch their camps right opposite each other, each on his
own side of the river.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Having waited here for two days
until Philippos arrived with the rest of the army, he sent
that general forward with the detachment he had brought
with him to the river Akesinês, with orders to continue
his march along the banks of that river. He also sent
Krateros and Hêphaistiôn off again with instructions how
they were to conduct the march. He himself continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
his voyage down the river Hydaspês, which was found
throughout the passage to be nowhere less than twenty
stadia in breadth. Mooring his boats wherever he could
on the banks, he subjected the Indians who lived near
the Hydaspês to his authority, some having surrendered
on terms of capitulation, and such as resorted to arms,
having been subdued by force. He then sailed rapidly
to the country of the Malloi and Oxydrakai, because
he had ascertained that they were the most numerous and
warlike of all the Indian tribes in those parts, and news
had reached him that they had conveyed their children,
and their wives for safety into their strongest cities,
and that they meant themselves to give him a hostile
reception. He in consequence prosecuted the voyage
with still greater speed, so that he might attack them
before they had settled their plans, and while their preparations
were still incomplete and they were in a state
of confusion and alarm. On the fifth day after he had
started from the place where he had halted, and been
joined by Krateros and Hêphaistiôn, he reached the junction
of the Hydaspês and Akesinês. Where these rivers
unite the one river formed from them is very narrow, and
not only is the current swift from the narrowness of the
channel, but the waters whirl round in monstrous eddies,
curl up in great billows, and dash so violently that the
roar of the surge is distinctly heard by those who are
still a great distance off. All this had been previously
reported by the natives to Alexander, and he had repeated
the information to the soldiers; but, notwithstanding, when
the army in approaching the confluence caught the roar
of the stream, the sailors simultaneously suspended the
action of the oars, not at any order from the boatswains,

they were stunned with terror by the thundering noise.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter V.—Dangers encountered by the fleet at the confluence—Plan
of the operations which followed—Voyage
down the Akesinês</i></h5>

<p>When they were not far from the meeting of the rivers,
the pilots enjoined the rowers to put all their strength to
the oars to clear the rapids, so that the vessels might not
be caught and capsized in the eddies, but by the exertions
of the rowers might overcome the whirling of the waters.
The merchant vessels accordingly, if they happened to be
whirled round by the current, suffered no damage from
the eddy, beyond the alarm caused to the men on board,
for these vessels, being of a round form, were kept upright
by the current itself, and settled into the proper course.
But the ships of war did not escape so unscathed from the
eddying stream, for, owing to their length, they were not
upheaved in the same way as the others on the seething
surges, and if they had two banks of oars, the lower oars
were not raised much above the level of the water. When
the broad sides, therefore, of these vessels were exposed
to the eddying current, their oars, if not lifted in proper
time, were caught by the water and the blades snapped
asunder. Many of the ships were thus damaged, and two
which fell foul of each other sunk with the greater part of
their crews. But when the river began to widen out, the
current was no longer so rapid and dangerous, and the
impetuosity of the eddies diminished. Alexander therefore
brought his fleet to moorings on the right bank where
there was a protection from the strength of the current
and a roadstead for the ships. Here was also a headland
projecting into the river which afforded facilities for collecting
the wrecks and whatever living freight they brought.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
He saved the survivors; and when he had repaired the
damaged craft, ordered Nearchos to sail downward till he
reached the confines of the nation called the Malloi. He
made himself an inroad into the territories of the barbarians
who refused their submission,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and prevented them
sending succours to the Malloi. He then rejoined the
fleet.</p>

<p>Hêphaistiôn, Krateros, and Philippos had there already
united their forces. He then transported to the other side
of the river Hydaspês the elephants, the brigade of Polysperchôn,
the archers, and Philippos with the troops under
his command, and appointed Krateros to conduct this
expedition. Nearchos he despatched in command of the
fleet, and instructed him to start on the voyage three days
before the departure of the army. The rest of his forces
he divided into three parts. Hêphaistiôn was directed to
set out five days in advance, so that if any of the enemy
fled forward before the division commanded by the king
in person they might be captured, when endeavouring to
escape in that direction, by falling into Hêphaistiôn’s
hands. He gave also a part of the army to Ptolemy, the
son of Lagos, with orders to follow him three days later,
so that such of the enemy as fled backward from his own
troops might fall into the hands of those under Ptolemy.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
The detachment that marched in advance he ordered to
wait until he himself should come up at the confluence of
the Akesinês and Hydraôtês,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> where Krateros and Ptolemy
had orders to join him with their divisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter VI.—Alexander invades the territories of the
Malloi</i></h5>

<p>Alexander selected for his own division the hypaspists,
the archers, the Agrianians, the corps of foot-guards under
Peithôn, all the horse-archers, and the half of the companion
cavalry, and led them through a waterless tract of
country against the Malloi,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> a race of independent Indians.
On the first day he encamped near a small stream which
was twenty stadia distant from the river Akesinês.
Having dined there and allowed the army a short time
for repose, he ordered every man to fill whatever vessel he
had with water. He then marched during the remainder
of the day and all night a distance of about 400 stadia,
and with the dawn arrived before a city to which many of
the Malloi had fled for refuge. As they never imagined
that Alexander would come to attack them through the
waterless desert, most of them were abroad in the fields,
and without their arms; and just as it was manifest that
he led his forces by this route because of the difficulties
it presented, so did it appear to the enemy past belief
that he would conduct an army by a way so perilous.
He thus fell upon them unexpectedly, and slew most of
them without their even turning to offer resistance, since
they were unarmed. The rest he shut up within the city,
and as the phalanx of infantry had not yet arrived, he
posted the cavalry in a cordon round the wall, thus
making it serve for a stockade. No sooner, however, did
the infantry come up than he despatched Perdikkas with
his own cavalry regiment and that of Kleitos, together
with the Agrianians, to another city of the Malloi, into
which many of the Indians of that district had fled
for refuge. He was enjoined to blockade the men in the
city, but not to attempt to storm the place until his own
arrival, so that no one might escape and carry the news of
Alexander’s approach to the other barbarians. He then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
made an assault upon the wall, which the barbarians
abandoned on seeing it could no longer hold out, since
many had been killed during the siege, and others disabled
for fighting by reason of their wounds. They fled
into the citadel, which, being seated on a commanding
height and difficult of access, they continued to defend
for some time. As the Macedonians, however, vigorously
pressed the attack at all points, while Alexander himself
was seen everywhere urging forward the work, the citadel
was stormed, and all the men who had fled to it for
refuge were put to the sword to the number of 2000.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Perdikkas meanwhile reached the city whither he had
been sent, but on learning that the inhabitants had not
long before fled from it, he rode away at full gallop on the
track of the fugitives, while the light troops followed him
on foot as fast as they could. Some of the fugitives he
overtook and killed, but such as had been too quick for
him made their escape to the river marshes.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter VII.—Siege and capture of several Mallian
strongholds</i></h5>

<p>Alexander having dined and allowed his troops to rest
till the first watch of the night, began to march forward,
and having travelled a great distance in the night, arrived
at the river Hydraôtês at daybreak. There he learned
that many of the Malloi had already crossed to the other
bank, but he fell upon others who were in the act of
crossing and slew many of them during the passage. He
crossed the river along with them, just as he was, and by
the same ford. He then closely pursued the fugitives who
had outstripped him in their retreat. Many of these he
slew and he captured others, but most of them escaped to
a position of great natural strength which was also strongly
fortified.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> But when the infantry came up with him,
Alexander sent Peithôn with his own brigade and two
squadrons of cavalry against the fugitives. This detachment
attacked the stronghold, captured it at the first
assault, and made slaves of all who had fled into it,
except, of course, those who had fallen in the attack.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Then Peithôn and his men, their task fulfilled, returned
to the camp.</p>

<p>Alexander himself next led his army against a certain
city of the Brachmans,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> because he had learned that many
of the Malloi had fled thither for refuge. On reaching it
he led the phalanx in compact ranks against all parts of
the wall. The inhabitants, on finding the walls undermined,
and that they were themselves obliged to retire
before the storm of missiles, left the walls and fled to the
citadel, and began to defend themselves from thence. But
as a few Macedonians had rushed in along with them,
they rallied, and turning round in a body upon the pursuers,
drove some from the citadel and killed twenty-five
of them in their retreat. Upon this Alexander ordered
his men to apply the scaling ladders to the citadel on all
its sides, and to undermine its walls; and when an undermined
tower had fallen and a breach had been made in
the wall between two towers, thus exposing the citadel to
attack in that quarter, Alexander was seen to be the first
man to scale and lay hold of the wall. Upon seeing this,
the rest of the Macedonians for very shame ascended the
wall at various points, and quickly had the citadel in their
hands. Some of the Indians set fire to their houses, in
which they were caught and killed, but most part fell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
fighting. About 5000 in all were killed, and, as they
were men of spirit, a few only were taken prisoners.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter VIII.—Alexander defeats the Malloi at the
Hydraôtês</i></h5>

<p>He remained there one day to give his army rest, and
next day he moved forward to attack the rest of the
Malloi. He found their cities abandoned, and ascertained
that the inhabitants had fled into the desert.
There he again allowed the army a day’s rest, and next
day sent Peithôn and Dêmêtrios, the cavalry commander,
back to the river with their own troops, and as many
battalions of light-armed infantry as the nature of the
work required. He directed them to march along the
edge of the river, and if they came upon any of those who
had fled for refuge to the jungle, of which there were
numerous patches along the river-bank, to put them all to
death unless they voluntarily surrendered. The troops
under these two officers captured many of the fugitives in
these jungles and killed them.</p>

<p>He marched himself against the largest city of the
Malloi, to which he was informed many men from their
other cities had fled for safety. The Indians, however,
abandoned this place also when they heard that Alexander
was approaching. They then crossed the Hydraôtês,
and with a view to obstruct Alexander’s passage, remained
drawn up in order of battle upon the banks, because they
were very steep. On learning this, he took all the cavalry
which he had with him, and marched to that part of the
Hydraôtês where he had been told the Malloi were
posted; and the infantry were directed to follow after
him. When he came to the river and descried the enemy
drawn up on the opposite bank, he plunged at once, just
as he was after the march, into the ford, with the cavalry
only. When the enemy saw Alexander now in the
middle of the stream they withdrew in haste, but yet in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
good order, from the bank, and Alexander pursued them
with the cavalry only. But when the Indians perceived
he had nothing but a party of horse with him, they faced
round and fought stoutly, being about 50,000 in number.
Alexander, perceiving that their phalanx was very compact,
and his own infantry not on the ground, rode along
all round them, and sometimes charged their ranks, but
not at close quarters. Meanwhile the Agrianians and
other battalions of light-armed infantry, which consisted
of picked men, arrived on the field along with the archers,
while the phalanx of infantry was showing in sight at no
great distance off. As they were threatened at once with
so many dangers, the Indians wheeled round, and with
headlong speed fled to the strongest of all the cities that
lay near.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Alexander killed many of them in the pursuit,
while those who escaped to the city were shut up within
its walls. At first, therefore, he surrounded the place with
his horsemen as soon as they came up from the march.
But when the infantry arrived he encamped around the
wall on every side for the remainder of this day—a time
too short for making an assault, to say nothing of the
great fatigue his army had undergone, the infantry from
their long march, and the cavalry by the continuous pursuit,
and especially by the passage of the river.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter IX.—Alexander assails the chief stronghold of the
Malloi, scales the wall of the citadel, into which he
leaps down though alone</i></h5>

<p>On the following day, dividing his army into two
parts, he himself assaulted the wall at the head of one
division, while Perdikkas led forward the other. Upon
this the Indians, without waiting to receive the attack of
the Macedonians, abandoned the walls and fled for refuge
to the citadel. Alexander and his troops therefore burst
open a small gate, and entered the city long before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
others. But Perdikkas and the troops under his command
entered it much later, having found it no easy work
to surmount the walls. The most of them, in fact, had
neglected to bring scaling ladders, for when they saw
the wall left without defenders they took it for granted
that the city had actually been captured. But when it
became clear that the enemy was still in possession of the
citadel, and that many of them were drawn up in front of
it to repel attack, the Macedonians endeavoured to force
their way into it, some by sapping the walls, and others
by applying the scaling ladders wherever that was practicable.
Alexander, thinking that the Macedonians who
carried the ladders were loitering too much, snatched one
from the man who carried it, placed it against the wall,
and began to ascend, cowering the while under his shield.
The next to follow was Peukestas, who carried the sacred
shield which Alexander had taken from the temple of the
Ilian Athênâ, and which he used to keep with him and
have carried before him in all his battles.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Next to him
Leonnatos, an officer of the bodyguard, ascended by the
same ladder; and by a different ladder Abreas, one of
those soldiers who for superior merit drew double pay<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
and allowances. The king was now near the coping of
the wall, and resting his shield against it, was pushing
some of the Indians within the fort, and had cleared the
parapet by killing others with his sword. The hypaspists,
now alarmed beyond measure for the king’s safety, pushed
each other in their haste up the same ladder and broke it,
so that those who were already mounting it fell down and
made the ascent impracticable for others.</p>

<p>Alexander, while standing on the wall, was then
assailed on every side from the adjacent towers, for none
of the Indians had the courage to come near him. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
was assailed also by men in the city, who threw darts at
him from no great distance off, for it so happened that a
mound of earth had been thrown up in that quarter close
to the wall. Alexander was, moreover, a conspicuous
object both by the splendour of his arms<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and the astonishing
audacity he displayed. He then perceived that if
he remained where he was, he would be exposed to
danger without being able to achieve anything noteworthy,
but if he leaped down into the citadel he might perhaps
by this very act paralyse the Indians with terror, and if
he did not, but necessarily incurred danger, he would in
that case not die ignobly, but after performing great deeds
worth being remembered by the men of after times.
Having so resolved, he leaped down from the wall into
the citadel. Then, supporting himself against the wall,
he slew with his sword some who assailed him at close
quarters, and in particular the governor of the Indians,
who had rushed upon him too boldly. Against another
Indian whom he saw approaching, he hurled a stone to
check his advance, and another he similarly repelled. If
any one came within nearer reach, he again used his
sword. The barbarians had then no further wish to
approach him, but standing around assailed him from all
quarters with whatever missiles they carried or could lay
their hands on.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter X.—Alexander is dangerously wounded within the
citadel</i></h5>

<p>At this crisis Peukestas, and Abreas the dimoirite, and
after them Leonnatos, the only men who succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
reaching the top of the wall before the ladder broke,
leaped down and began fighting in front of the king.
But there Abreas fell, pierced in the forehead by an
arrow. Alexander himself was also struck by one which
pierced through his cuirass into his chest above the pap,
so that, as Ptolemy says, air gurgled from the wound
along with the blood. But sorely wounded as he was, he
continued to defend himself as long as his blood was still
warm. Since much blood, however, kept gushing out
with every breath he drew, a dizziness and faintness seized
him, and he fell where he stood in a collapse upon his
shield. Peukestas then bestrode him where he fell, holding
up in front of him the sacred shield which had been
taken from Ilion, while Leonnatos protected him from
side attacks. But both these men were severely wounded,
and Alexander was now on the point of swooning away
from the loss of blood. As for the Macedonians, they
were at a loss how to make their way into the citadel,
because those who had seen Alexander shot at upon the
wall and then leap down inside it had broken down the
ladders up which they were rushing in all haste, dreading
lest their king, in recklessly exposing himself to danger,
should come by some hurt. In their perplexity they
devised various plans for ascending the wall. It was
made of earth, and so some drove pegs into it, and swinging
themselves up by means of these, scrambled with
difficulty to the top. Others ascended by mounting one
upon the other. The man who first reached the top
flung himself headlong from the wall into the city, and
was followed by the others. There, when they saw the
king fallen prostrate, they all raised loud lamentations
and outcries of grief. And now around his fallen form a
desperate struggle ensued, one Macedonian after another
holding his shield in front of him. In the meantime,
some of the soldiers having shattered the bar by which
the gate in the wall between the towers was secured, made
their way into the city a few at a time, and others, when
they saw that a rift was made in the gate, put their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
shoulders under it, and having then pushed it into the
space within the wall, opened an entrance into the citadel
in that quarter.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XI.—Dangerous nature of Alexander’s wound—Arrian
refutes some current fictions relating to this
accident</i></h5>

<p>Upon this some began to kill the Indians, and in the
massacre spared none, neither man, woman, nor child.
Others bore off the king upon his shield. His condition
was very low, and they could not yet tell whether he was
likely to survive. Some writers have asserted that
Kritodêmos, a physician of Kôs, an Asklêpiad by birth,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
extracted the weapon from the wound by making an
incision where the blow had struck. Other writers, however,
say that as no surgeon was present at this terrible
crisis, Perdikkas, an officer of the bodyguard, at Alexander’s
own desire, made an incision into the wound with his sword
and removed the weapon. Its removal was followed by
such a copious effusion of blood that Alexander again
swooned, and the swoon had the effect of staunching the
flux. Many fictions also have been recorded by historians
concerning this accident, and Fame, receiving them from
the original inventors, has preserved them to our own day,
nor will she cease to transmit the falsehoods to one
generation after another except they be finally suppressed
by this history.</p>

<p>The common account, for example, is that this accident
befell Alexander among the Oxydrakai, but in fact it
occurred among the Malloi an independent Indian nation.
The city belonged to the Malloi, and the men who
wounded Alexander were Malloi. They had certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
agreed to combine with the Oxydrakai and give battle to
the common enemy, but Alexander had thwarted this
design by his sudden and rapid march through the waterless
country, whereby these tribes were prevented from
giving each other mutual help. To take another instance,
according to the common account, the last battle fought
with Darius (that at which he fled, nor paused in his flight
till he was seized by the soldiers of Bêssos and murdered
at Alexander’s approach) took place at Arbêla, just as the
previous battle came off at Issos, and the first cavalry
action at the Granikos. Now this cavalry action was
really fought at the Granikos, and the next battle with
Darius at Issos. But Arbêla is distant from the field
where Darius and Alexander had their last battle 600
stadia according to those authors who make the distance
greatest, and 500 stadia according to those who make it
least. But Ptolemy and Aristoboulos say that the battle
took place at Gaugamêla near the river Boumodos. Gaugamêla,
however, was not a city, but merely a good-sized village,
a place of no distinction, and bearing a name which offends
the ear. This seems to me the reason why Arbêla, which
was a city, has carried off the glory of the great battle.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> But
if we must perforce consider that this battle took place near
Arbêla, though fought at so great a distance off, then we
may as well say that the sea fight at Salamis came off
near the Isthmus of Corinth, and the sea-fight at Artemision
in Euboia, near Aigina or Sunium.</p>

<p>With regard again to those who protected Alexander
with their shields in his peril, all agree that Peukestas was
of the number, but with respect to Leonnatos and Abreas
the dimoirite, they are no longer in harmony. Some say
that Alexander received a blow on his helmet from a
bludgeon and fell down in an access of dizziness, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
on regaining his feet he was hit by a dart which pierced
through his breastplate into his chest. But Ptolemy, the
son of Lagos, says that this wound in his chest was the
only one he received. I take, however, the following to
be the greatest error into which the historians of Alexander
have fallen. Some have written that Ptolemy, the son of
Lagos, along with Peukestas mounted the ladder together
with Alexander; that Ptolemy held his shield over him
when he was lying on the ground,
and that he thence received the surname
of Sôtêr.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> And yet Ptolemy
himself has recorded that he was not
present at this conflict, but was fighting
elsewhere against other barbarians,
in command of a different
division of the army. Let me
mention these facts in digressing
from my narrative that the men of
after times may not regard it as a matter of indifference
how these great deeds and great sufferings are reported.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XII.—Distress and anxiety of the army at the
prospect of Alexander’s death</i></h5>

<p>While Alexander remained at this place to be cured of
his wound, the first news which reached the camp whence
he had started to attack the Malloi was that he had died
of his wound. Then there arose at first a loud lamentation
from the whole army, as the mournful tidings spread
from man to man. But when their lamentation was ended,
they gave way to despondency and anxious doubts about
the appointment of a commander to the army, for among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
the officers many could advance claims to that dignity
which both to Alexander and the Macedonians seemed of
equal weight. They were also in fear and doubt how
they could be conducted home in safety, surrounded as
they were on all hands by warlike nations, some not yet
reduced, but likely to fight resolutely for their freedom,
while others would to a certainty revolt when relieved from
their fear of Alexander. They seemed besides to be just
then among impassable rivers, while the whole outlook
presented nothing but inextricable difficulties when they
wanted their king. But on receiving word that he was
still alive, they could hardly think it true, or persuade
themselves that he was likely to recover. Even when a
letter came from the king himself intimating that he would
soon come down to the camp, most of them from the
excess of fear which possessed them distrusted the news,
for they fancied that the letter was a forgery concocted by
his body-guards and generals.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XIII.—Joy of the army on seeing Alexander after
his recovery—His officers rebuke him for his rashness</i></h5>

<p>On coming to know this, Alexander, anxious to prevent
any commotions arising in the army, as soon as he could
bear the fatigue, had himself conveyed to the banks of the
river Hydraôtês, and embarking there, he sailed down the
river to reach the camp, at the junction of the Hydraôtês
and the Akesinês, where Hêphaistiôn commanded the
land forces and Nearchos the fleet. When the vessel
which carried the king was now approaching the camp, he
ordered the awning to be removed from the poop that he
might be visible to all. They were, however, even yet
incredulous, supposing that the freight of the vessel was
Alexander’s dead body, until he neared the bank, when he
raised his arm and stretched out his hand to the multitude.
Then the men raised a loud cheer, and lifted up their
hands, some towards heaven and some towards Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
himself. Tears even started involuntarily to the eyes of
not a few at the unexpected sight. Some of the hypaspists
brought him a litter where he was carried ashore from the
vessel, but he called for his horse. When he was seen
once more on horseback, the whole army greeted him with
loud acclamations, which filled with their echoes the shores
and all the surrounding hills and dales. On approaching
his tent he dismounted that he might be seen walking.
Then the soldiers crowded round him, touching some his
hands, others his knees, and others nothing but his raiment.
Some, satisfied with nothing more than a near view, went
away with expressions of admiration. Others again
covered him with garlands, and others with the flowers of
the clime and the season.</p>

<p>Nearchos says that he was offended with certain of his
friends who reproached him for exposing himself to danger
when leading the army, for this, they said, was not the
duty of a commander, but of a common soldier, and it
seems to me that Alexander resented these remarks
because he felt their truth, and knew he had laid himself
open to censure. Owing, however, to his prowess in
fighting and his love of glory, he, like other men who are
swayed by some predominant pleasure, yielded to temptation,
lacking sufficient force of will to hold aloof from
dangers. Nearchos also says that a certain elderly Boiôtian
(whose name he does not give) observing that Alexander
resented the censures of his friends, and was giving them
sour looks, approached him, and in the Boiôtian tongue
thus addressed him: “O Alexander, it is for heroes to do
great deeds,” and then he subjoined an Iambic verse, the
purport of which was that he who did any great deed was
bound also to suffer.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The man, it is said, not only found
favour with Alexander, but was admitted afterwards to
closer intimacy.</p>

<p>At this time envoys came to Alexander from the
Malloi who still survived, tendering the submission of the
nation; and from the Oxydrakai came the leading men of
their cities and their provincial governors, besides 150 of
their most eminent men, entrusted with full powers to conclude
a treaty. They brought with them those presents
which the Indians consider the choicest, and, like the
Malloi, tendered the submission of their nation. Their
error in so long delaying to send an embassy was, they
said, pardonable, for they were attached more than others
to freedom and autonomy, and their freedom they had
preserved intact from the time Dionysos came to India
until Alexander’s arrival. Since, however, Alexander was
also, according to current report, of the race of the gods,
they were willing, if he so pleased, to receive whatever
satrap Alexander might appoint, pay the tribute he chose
to impose, and give as many hostages as he required.
Upon this he asked for a 1000 men, the flower of the
nation, to be retained, if he thought good, as hostages,
but, if not, to be employed as auxiliaries until he had
finished the war against the other Indians. They selected
accordingly 1000 men, their best and tallest, and sent
them to him, together with 500 chariots and their
charioteers, though these were not demanded. Alexander
appointed Philippos as satrap over that nation and over
the Malloi who still survived. The hostages he sent back,
but he kept the chariots.</p>

<p>When these arrangements had been completed, and
many vessels had been built in the interval while his
wound was healing, he put on board the fleet 1700 of the
cavalry companions, the same number of light-armed troops
as before, and about 10,000 infantry, and sailed a short
distance down the river Hydraôtês. But when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Hydraôtês fell into the Akesinês he continued the voyage
down the latter river (which in preference to the Hydraôtês
gives its name to the united stream) until he reached the
junction of the Akesinês with the Indus. For these four
vast rivers which are all navigable yield up their waters to
the river Indus, but not each of them under its own special
name. For the Hydaspês discharges into the Akesinês,
and the single stream then forms what is called the
Akesinês. But this Akesinês again unites with the
Hydraôtês, and after absorbing this river is still the
Akesinês. The Akesinês after this receives the Hyphasis,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
and still keeping its own name falls into the Indus, but
after the junction it resigns its name to that river. Hence
I am ready to believe that the Indus from this point to
where it bifurcates to form the Delta expands to a breadth
of 100 stadia or even more in places where it spreads out
more like a lake than a river.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XV.—Appointment of Satraps—Voyage down
the Indus to the dominions of Mousikanos, who tenders
his submission</i></h5>

<p>There at the confluence of the Akesinês and Indus
he waited until Perdikkas arrived with his forces. This
general in the course of his march had subjugated the
Abastanoi,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> one of the independent tribes. Meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
there arrived at the camp other thirty-oared galleys and
transport vessels which had been built for him among the
Xathroi,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> another independent tribe of Indians whose
submission he had received. From the Ossadioi<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> also,
another independent tribe, came envoys offering the submission
of their nation. Alexander then fixed the confluence
of the Akesinês and Indus as the boundary of the
satrapy of Philippos, and left with him all the Thracians
and as many foot-soldiers as seemed sufficient for the
defence of his province. Then he ordered a city to be
founded there at the very confluence of the rivers,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> hoping
it would become a great city and make a name for itself
in the world. He ordered also the construction of dockyards.
At this time the Baktrian Oxyartês, the father
of Alexander’s wife Roxana, arrived, and on him he bestowed
the satrapy of the Parapamisadai after dismissing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
the previous satrap Tyriaspês, who had been reported
guilty of irregularities in the exercise of his authority.</p>

<p>Then he transported Krateros, with the bulk of the
army and the elephants, to the left side of the river
Indus, because the route along that bank of the river
seemed easier for an army heavily accoutred, and because
the tribes inhabiting those parts were not quite friendly.
He sailed himself down to the capital of the Sôgdoi, where
he fortified another city, constructed other dockyards, and
repaired his damaged vessels. He then appointed Oxyartês
and Peithôn satraps of the country which extended
from the confluence of the Indus and Akesinês to the sea,
together with the whole sea-board of India.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Krateros he again despatched with the army [through
the country of the Arachôtians and Drangians]; while he
sailed down himself to the realm of Mousikanos,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> which
was reported to be the most opulent in India, because
that sovereign had neither come to surrender himself and
his country, nor sent envoys to seek his friendship. He
had not even sent presents to show the respect due to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
mighty king, nor had he asked any favour from Alexander.
He therefore made the voyage down the river so rapidly
that he reached the frontiers of the country of Mousikanos
before that prince had even heard that Alexander had
started to attack him. Mousikanos, dismayed by his
sudden arrival, hastened to meet him, taking the choicest
presents India could offer and all his elephants with him.
He offered to surrender both his nation and himself, and
acknowledged his error, which was the most effective way
with Alexander to obtain from him whatever one wanted.
Alexander therefore granted Mousikanos a full pardon on
account of his submission and penitence, expressed much
admiration of his capital and his realm, and confirmed
him in his sovereignty. Krateros was then ordered to
fortify the citadel which protected the capital, and this
work was executed while Alexander was still on the spot.
A garrison was placed in the fortress, which he thought
suitable for keeping the surrounding tribes in subjection.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XVI.—Campaign against Oxykanos and Sambos</i></h5>

<p>Then he took the archers and the Agrianians and the
cavalry which was sailing with him, and marched against
the governor of a district in that part of the country whose
name was Oxykanos, because he neither came himself
nor sent envoys to offer the surrender of himself and his
country.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> At the first assault he took by storm the two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
largest cities under the rule of Oxykanos, in the second
of which that chief himself was taken prisoner. The
booty he gave to the army, but the elephants he led away
and reserved for himself. The other cities in the same
country surrendered without attempting resistance wherever
he advanced; so much were the minds of all the
Indians paralysed with abject terror by Alexander and
the success of his arms.</p>

<p>He then advanced against Sambos, whom he had
appointed satrap of the Indian mountaineers, and who
was reported to have fled on hearing that Mousikanos
had been pardoned by Alexander, and was ruling his own
land, for he and Mousikanos were on hostile terms. But
when Alexander approached the city called Sindimana,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
which formed the metropolis of the country of Sambos,
the gates were thrown open on his arrival, and the members
of the household of Sambos with his treasure (of
which they had reckoned up the amount) and his elephants
went forth to meet him. Sambos, these men informed
him, had fled, not from hostility to Alexander, but from
fears to which the pardon of Mousikanos had given rise.
He captured besides another city,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> which had at this time
revolted, and he put to death all those Brachmans who
had instigated the revolt. These Brachmans are the
philosophers of the Indians, and of their philosophy, if so
it may be called, I shall give an account in my work
which describes India.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XVII.—Mousikanos is captured by Peithôn and
executed—Alexander reaches Patala at the apex of the
Indus Delta</i></h5>

<p>Meantime he received word that Mousikanos had
revolted. Thereupon he despatched the satrap Peithôn,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
the son of Agênor, against him with an adequate force,
while he marched himself against the cities which had
been placed under the rule of Mousikanos. Some of
these he razed to the ground after reducing the inhabitants
to slavery; into others he introduced garrisons and
fortified their citadels. When these operations were
finished he returned to the camp and the fleet—whither
Mousikanos was conducted, who had been taken prisoner
by Peithôn. Alexander ordered the rebel to be taken
to his own country and hanged there, together with all
those Brachmans who had instigated him to revolt. Then
there came to him the ruler of the country of the Patalians,
which, as I have stated, consists of the Delta formed by
the river Indus, and is larger than the Egyptian Delta.
This chief surrendered to him the whole of his land, and
entrusted both himself and all his possessions to him.
Alexander sent him back to his government with orders
to make all due preparations for the reception of his
expedition. He then sent away Krateros into Karmania
by the route through the Arachôtians and the Sarangians,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
leading the brigades of Attalos, Meleager, and Antigenês,
along with some of the archers and such of the companions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
and other Macedonians as he was sending home
to Macedonia as unfit for further service. He also sent
away the elephants with him. The rest of the army,
except that portion which with himself was sailing down
to the sea, was placed under the command of Hêphaistiôn.
Peithôn, who led the horse-lancers and the Agrianians, he
transported to the opposite bank so that he might not be
on that side of the river by which Hêphaistiôn was to
advance. Peithôn was instructed to put colonists into
the cities which had just been fortified, to suppress any
insurrection which the Indians might attempt, to introduce
settled order among them, and then to join him at Patala.</p>

<p>On the third day after Alexander had started on the
voyage, he was informed that the Prince of Patala was
fleeing from that city, taking with him most of its inhabitants,
and leaving the country deserted. He accordingly
accelerated his voyage down the river, and on
reaching Patala found that both the city itself and the
cultivated lands which lay around it had been deserted
by the inhabitants. But he despatched his lightest troops
in pursuit of the fugitives, and when some of these had
been captured sent them on to their countrymen to bid
them take courage and return, for they were free to inhabit
their city and cultivate their lands as formerly; and
so most of them did return.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter XVIII.—Alexander orders wells to be dug in the
district round Patala, and sails down the western arm
of the Indus</i></h5>

<p>After directing Hêphaistiôn to construct a citadel in
Patala, he sent out men into the adjacent country, which
was waterless, to dig wells<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and make it habitable. Some
of the barbarians in the neighbourhood attacked them,
and, as they fell upon them quite unexpectedly, killed
several of their number, but as the assailants lost many
on their own side, they fled to the desert. The men were
thus able to complete the work they were sent to execute,
especially as Alexander, on learning that they had been
attacked by the barbarians, had sent additional troops to
take part in the work.</p>

<p>Near Patala the stream of the Indus is divided into
two large rivers,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> both of which retain the name of the
Indus till they enter the sea. Here Alexander set about
the construction of a roadstead and dock, and when some
satisfactory progress had been made with these undertakings,
he resolved to sail down to the mouth of the right
arm of the river.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> To Leonnatos he gave the command
of about 1000 cavalry and 8000 heavy and light infantry,
and despatched him to move down the island of Patala,
holding along the shore in a line with the squadron of
ships. He set out himself on a voyage down the right
arm of the river, taking with him the fastest vessels with
one and a half bank of oars, all the thirty-oared galleys,
and several of the smaller craft. As the Indians of that
region had fled, he had no pilot to direct his course, and
this made the navigation all the more difficult. Then on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
the second day after he had started a storm arose, and
the gale blowing against the current made deep furrows
in the river, and battered the hulls of the vessels so
violently that most of his ships were damaged, while some
of the thirty-oared galleys were completely wrecked, though
the sailors managed to run them on shore before they
went all to pieces in the water. Other vessels were therefore
constructed; and Alexander, having despatched the
quickest of the light-armed troops some distance into the
interior, captured some Indians, whom he employed in
piloting his fleet for the rest of the voyage. But when
they found themselves where the river expands to the
vast breadth of 200 stadia the wind blew strong from
the outer sea, and the oars could scarcely be raised in the
swell. They therefore again drew toward the shore for
refuge, and the fleet was steered by the pilots into the
mouth of a canal.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XIX.—The fleet is damaged by the tide, halts at an
island in the Indus, and thence reaches the open sea</i></h5>

<p>While the fleet was at anchor here, a vicissitude to
which the Great Sea is subject occurred, for the tide ebbed,
and their ships were left on dry ground. This phenomenon,
of which Alexander and his followers had no
previous experience, caused them no little alarm, and
greater still was their dismay, when in due course of time
the tide advanced, and the hulls of the vessels were
floated aloft. Those vessels which it found settled in
the soft mud were uplifted without damage, and floated
again, nothing the worse for the strain; but as for those
vessels which had been left on a drier part of the beach,
and were not firmly embedded, some on the advance
of a massive wave fell foul of each other, while others
were dashed upon the strand and shattered in pieces.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
Alexander caused these vessels to be repaired as well as
circumstances allowed, and despatched men in advance
down the river in two boats to explore an island at
which the natives informed him he must anchor on his way
to the sea. They said that the name of the island was
Killouta.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> When he learned that the island had harbours,
was of great extent, and yielded water, he ordered the
rest of the fleet to make its way thither, but he himself
with the fastest sailing ships advanced beyond the island
to see the mouth of the river, and ascertain whether it
offered a safe and easy passage out into the open main.
When they had proceeded about 200 stadia beyond the
island, they descried another which lay out in the sea.
Then they returned to the island in the river, and
Alexander, having anchored his ships near its extremity,
offered sacrifice to those gods to whom, he said, Ammôn
had enjoined him to sacrifice. On the following day he
sailed down to the other island which lay in the ocean,
and approaching close to it also, offered other sacrifices to
other gods and in another manner. These sacrifices, like
the others, he offered under sanction of an oracle given
by Ammôn. He then advanced beyond the mouths of
the river Indus, and sailed out into the great main to
discover, as he declared, whether any land lay anywhere
near in the sea, but, in my opinion, chiefly that it might
be said that he had navigated the great outer sea of
India. He then sacrificed bulls to the god Pôseidôn,
which he threw into the sea; and following up the
sacrifice with a libation, he threw the goblet and
bowls of gold into the bosom of the deep as thanks-offerings,
beseeching the god to conduct in safety the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
naval expedition which he intended to despatch under
Nearchos to the Persian Gulf and the mouths of the
Euphrates and Tigris.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XX.—Alexander after returning to Patala sails
down the eastern arm of the Indus</i></h5>

<p>On his return to Patala, he found the citadel fortified,
and Peithôn arrived with his troops after completing the
objects of his expedition. Hêphaistiôn was then ordered
to prepare what was requisite for the fortification of the
harbour, and the construction of a dockyard, for here at
the city of Patala, which stands where the river Indus
bifurcates, he meant to leave behind him a very considerable
naval squadron.</p>

<p>He himself sailed down again to the Great Sea by the
other mouth of the Indus,<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> to ascertain by which of the
mouths it was easier to reach the ocean. The mouths of
the river Indus are about 1800 stadia distant from each
other.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> When he was approaching the mouth, he came
to a large lake formed by the river in widening out,
unless, indeed, this watery expanse be due to rivers which
discharge their streams into it from the surrounding
districts, and give it the appearance of a gulf of the sea;<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
for salt-water fish were now seen in it of larger size
than the fish in our sea. Having anchored in the lake,
at a place selected by the pilots, he left there most of
the soldiers under the command of Leonnatos and all
the boats, while he himself with the thirty-oared galleys,
and the vessels with one and a half bank of oars passed
beyond the mouth of the Indus, and sailing out into the
sea by this other route, satisfied himself that the mouth
of the Indus on this side was easier to navigate than the
other. He then anchored his fleet near the beach, and
taking with him some of the cavalry, proceeded along the
shore a three days’ journey, examining what sort of a
country it was for a coasting voyage, and ordering wells
to be sunk for supplying sea-farers with water. He then
returned to the fleet, and sailed back to Patala. He sent,
however, a part of the army to complete the work
of digging wells along the shore, with instructions to
return to Patala on their completing this service. Sailing
down again to the lake, he constructed there another
harbour and other docks, and, having left a garrison in
the place, he collected sufficient food to supply the army
for four months, and made all other necessary preparations
for the voyage along the coast.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXI.—Alexander crosses the river Arabios and
invades the Oreitai</i></h5>

<p>The season of the year was impracticable for navigation
from the prevalence of the Etesian winds, which
do not blow there as with us from the north, but come
as a south wind from the Great Ocean. It was ascertained
that from the beginning of winter, that is from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
setting of the Pleiades,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> till the winter solstice, the
weather was suitable for making voyages, because the
mild breezes which then blow steadily seaward from the
land, which is drenched by this time with heavy rains,
favour coasting voyages, whether made by oar or by
sail. Nearchos, who had been appointed to the command
of the fleet, was waiting for the season for coasting, but
Alexander set out from Patala, and advanced with the
whole of his army to the river Arabios.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> He then took
half of the hypaspists and archers, the infantry brigades
called foot companions, the corps of companion cavalry,
and a squadron from each division of the other cavalry,
and all the horse archers, and turned towards the sea,
which lay on the left, not only to dig as many wells as
possible for the use of the expedition while coasting
those shores, but also to fall suddenly upon the Oreitai
(an Indian tribe in those parts which had long been
independent), because they had rendered no friendly
service either to himself or the army. The command of
the troops which he did not take with him was entrusted
to Hêphaistiôn. There was settled near the river Arabios
another<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> independent tribe called the Arabitai, and, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
these neither thought themselves a match for Alexander,
nor yet wished to submit to him, they fled into
the desert when they learned that he was marching
against them. But Alexander having crossed the Arabios,
which was neither broad nor deep, traversed the most of
the desert, and found himself by daybreak near the
inhabited country. Then leaving orders with the infantry
to follow him in regular line, he set forward with the
cavalry, which he divided into squadrons, to be spread
over a wide extent of the plain, and it was thus he
marched into the country of the Oreitai.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> All who turned
to offer resistance were cut down by the cavalry, but
many were taken prisoners. He then encamped near a
small sheet of water, and on being joined by the troops
under Hêphaistiôn still continued his progress, and arrived
at the village called Rambakia,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> which was the largest in
the dominions of the Oreitai. He was pleased with the
situation, and thought that if he colonised it, it would
become a great and prosperous city. He therefore
left Hêphaistiôn behind him to carry this scheme into
effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXII.—Submission of the Oreitai—Description of
the Gadrôsian desert</i></h5>

<p>He then took again the half of the hypaspists and
Agrianians, and the corps of cavalry and the horse-archers,
and marched forward to the frontiers of the Gadrôsoi and
the Oreitai, where he was informed his way would lie
through a narrow defile before which the combined forces
of the Oreitai and the Gadrôsoi were lying encamped,
resolved to prevent his passage. They were in fact
drawn up there, but when they were apprised of Alexander’s
approach most of them deserted the posts they
were guarding and fled from the pass. Then the leaders
of the Oreitai came to him to surrender themselves and
their nation. He ordered them to collect the multitude
of the Oreitai, and send them away to their homes, since
they were not to be subjected to any bad treatment.
Over these people he placed Apollophanês as satrap.
Along with him he left Leonnatos, an officer of the body-guard
in Ora,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> in command of all the Agrianians, some of
the archers and cavalry, and the rest of the Grecian
mercenary infantry and cavalry, and instructed him to
remain in the country till the fleet sailed past its shores,
to settle a colony in the city, and establish order among
the Oreitai, so that they might be readier to pay respect
and obedience to the satrap. He himself with the great
bulk of the army (for Hêphaistiôn had now rejoined him
with his detachment) advanced to the country of the
Gadrôsoi<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> by a route mostly desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>Aristoboulos says that myrrh-trees larger than the
common kind grow plentifully in this desert, and that the
Phoenicians who followed the army as suttlers collected
the drops of myrrh which oozed out in great abundance
from the trees (their stems being large and hitherto uncropped),
and conveyed away the produce loaded on their
beasts of burden. He says also that this desert yields an
abundance of odoriferous roots of nard, which the Phoenicians
likewise collected; but much of it was trodden down
by the army, and the sweet perfume thus crushed out of
it was from its great abundance diffused far and wide
over the country.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Other kinds of trees are found in the
desert, one in particular which had a foliage like that of
the laurel, and grew in places washed by the waves of the
sea. These trees when the tide ebbed were left in dry
ground, but when it returned they looked as if they grew
in the sea. The roots of some were always washed by
the sea, since they grew in hollows from which the water
never receded, and yet trees of this kind were not destroyed
by the brine. Some of these trees attained here the great
height of 30 cubits. They happened to be at that
season in bloom, and their flower closely resembled the
white violet,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> which, however, it far surpassed in the
sweetness of its perfume. Another kind of thorny stalk
is mentioned, which grew on dry land, and was armed
with a thorn so strong that when it got entangled in the
dress of some who were riding past, it rather pulled the
rider down from his horse than was itself torn away from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
its stalk. When hares are running past these bushes
the thorns are said to fasten themselves in the fur so
that the hares are caught like birds with bird-lime or fish
with hooks. These thorns were, however, easily cut
through with steel, and when severed the stalk yielded
juice even more abundant and more acid than what flows
from fig-trees in springtime.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXIII.—Alexander marching through Gadrôsia
endeavours to collect supplies for the fleet</i></h5>

<p>Thence he marched through the country of the
Gadrôsoi by a difficult route, on which it was scarcely
possible to procure the necessaries of life, and which often
failed to yield water for the army. They were besides
compelled to march most of the way by night, and at too
great a distance from the sea; for Alexander wished to
go along the sea-coast, both to see what harbours it had,
and to make in the course of his march whatever preparations
were possible for the benefit of the fleet, either
by making his men dig wells or seek out markets and
anchorages. The maritime parts of Gadrôsia were, however,
entirely desert. Nevertheless he sent Thoas, the son
of Mandradôros, down to the sea with a few horsemen to
see if there happened to be any anchorage or water not
far from the sea, or anything else that could supply the
wants of the fleet. This man on returning reported that
he found some fishermen upon the beach living in stifling
huts, which had been constructed by heaping up mussel
shells, while the roofs were formed of the backbones of
fish. He also reported that these fishermen had only
scanty supplies of water, obtained with difficulty by their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
digging through the shingle, and that what they got was
far from sweet.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>When Alexander came to a district of the Gadrôsian
country where corn was more abundant, he seized it,
placed it upon the beasts of burden, and having marked
it with his own seal ordered it to be conveyed to the sea.
But when he was coming to the halting station nearest
the sea, the soldiers paid but little regard to the seal, and
even the guards themselves made use of the corn and
gave a share of it to such as were most pinched with
hunger. Indeed, they were so overcome by their sufferings,
that, as reason dictated, they took more account of the
impending danger with which they now stood face to face
than of the unseen and remote danger of the king’s resentment.
Alexander, however, forgave the offenders when
made aware of the necessity which had prompted their
act. He himself scoured the country in search of provisions,
and sent Krêtheus the Kallatian<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> with all the
supplies he could collect for the use of the army which
was sailing round with the fleet. He also ordered the
natives to grind all the corn they could collect in the
interior districts, and convey it, for sale to the army,
along with dates and sheep. He besides sent Telephos,
one of the companions, to another locality with a small
supply of ground corn.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXIV.—Difficulties encountered on the march
through Gadrôsia</i></h5>

<p>He then advanced towards the capital of the Gadrôsoi,
called Poura,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and arrived there in sixty days after he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
started from Ora. Most of Alexander’s historians admit
that all the hardships which his army suffered in Asia are
not to be compared with the miseries which it here experienced.
Nearchos is the only author who says that
Alexander did not take that route in ignorance of its difficulty,
but that he chose it on learning that no one had as
yet traversed it with an army except Semiramis when she
fled from India. The natives of the country say that she
escaped with only twenty men of all her army, while even
Cyrus, the son of Kambyses, escaped with only seven. For
Cyrus, they say, did in truth enter this region to invade
India, but lost, before reaching it, the greater part of his
army from the difficulties which beset his march through
the desert. When Alexander heard these accounts he was
seized, it is said, with an ambition to outrival both Cyrus
and Semiramis. Nearchos says that this motive, added to
his desire to be near the coast in order to keep the fleet
supplied with provisions, induced him to march by this
route; but that the blazing heat and want of water destroyed
a great part of the army, and especially the beasts
of burden, which perished from the great depth of the sand,
and the heat which scorched like fire, while a great many
died of thirst. For they met, he says, with lofty ridges of
deep sand not hard and compact, but so loose that those
who stepped on it sunk down as into mud or rather into
untrodden snow. The horses and mules besides suffered
still more severely both in ascending and descending the
ridges, because the road was not only uneven, but wanted
firmness. The great distances also between the stages
were most distressing to the army, compelled as it was at
times from want of water to make marches above the
ordinary length. When they traversed by night all the
stage they had to complete and came to water in the
morning, their distress was all but entirely relieved. But
if as the day advanced they were caught still marching
owing to the great length of the stage, then suffer
they did, tortured alike by raging heat and thirst
unquenchable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXV.—Sufferings of the army in the Gadrôsian
desert</i></h5>

<p>The soldiers destroyed many of the beasts of burden
of their own accord. For when their provisions ran short
they came together and killed most of the horses and mules.
They ate the flesh of these animals, which they professed
had died of thirst and perished from the heat. No one
cared to look very narrowly into the exact nature of what
was doing, both because of the prevailing distress and
also because all were alike implicated in the same offence.
Alexander himself was not unaware of what was going
on, but he saw that the remedy for the existing state of
things was to pretend ignorance of it rather than permit
it as a matter that lay within his cognisance. It was
therefore no longer easy to convey the soldiers labouring
under sickness, nor others who had fallen behind on the
march from exhaustion. This arose not only from the
want of beasts of burden, but also because the men themselves
took to destroying the waggons when they could no
longer drag them forward owing to the deepness of the
sand. They had done this even in the early stages of
the march, because for the sake of the waggons they had
to go not by the shortest roads, but those easiest for
carriages. Thus some were left behind on the road from
sickness, others from fatigue or the effects of the heat or
intolerable thirst, while there were none who could take
them forward or remain to tend them in their sickness.
For the army marched on apace, and in the anxiety for
its safety as a whole the care of individuals was of
necessity disregarded. As they generally made their
marches by night, some of the men were overcome by
sleep on the way, but on awaking afterwards those who
still had some strength left followed close on the track of
the army, and a few out of many saved their lives by
overtaking it. The majority perished in the sand like
shipwrecked men at sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>Another disaster also befell the army which seriously
affected the men themselves as well as the horses and the
beasts of burden. For the country of the Gadrôsians, like
that of the Indians, is supplied with rains by the Etesian
winds; but these rains do not fall on the Gadrôsian
plains, but on the mountains to which the clouds are
carried by the wind, where they dissolve in rain without
passing over the crests of the mountains. When
the army on one occasion lay encamped for the night
near a small winter torrent for the sake of its water, the
torrent which passes that way about the second watch
of the night became swollen by rains which had fallen
unperceived by the army, and came rushing down with so
great a deluge that it destroyed most of the women and
children of the camp-followers, and swept away all the
royal baggage and whatever beasts of burden were still
left. The soldiers themselves, after a hard struggle, barely
escaped with their lives, and a portion only of their
weapons. Many of them besides came by their death
through drinking, for if when jaded by the broiling heat
and thirst they fell in with abundance of water, they
quaffed it with insatiable avidity till they killed themselves.
For this reason Alexander generally pitched his camp not
in the immediate vicinity of the watering-places, but some
twenty stadia off to prevent the men and beasts from
rushing in crowds into the water to the danger of their
lives, as well as to prohibit those who had no self-control
from polluting the water for the rest of the troops by
their stepping into the springs or streams.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXVI.—Incidents of the march through Gadrôsia</i></h5>

<p>Here I feel myself bound not to pass over in silence a
noble act performed by Alexander, perhaps the noblest
in his record, which occurred either in this country or,
as some other authors have asserted, still earlier, among
the Parapamisadai. The story is this. The army was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
prosecuting its march through the sand under a sun already
blazing high because a halt could not be made till water,
which lay on the way farther on was reached, and
Alexander himself, though distressed with thirst, was
nevertheless with pain and difficulty marching on foot at
the head of his army, that the soldiers might, as they
usually do in a case of the kind, more cheerfully bear their
hardships when they saw the misery equalised. But in
the meantime some of the light-armed soldiers, starting off
from the army, found water collected in the shallow bed
of a torrent in a small and impure spring. Having,
with difficulty, collected this water they hastened off to
Alexander as if they were the bearers of some great boon.
As soon as they came near the king they poured the
water into a helmet, and offered it to him. He took it
and thanked the men who brought it, but at once poured
it upon the ground in the sight of all. By this deed the
whole army was inspired with fresh vigour to such a
degree that one would have imagined that the water
poured out by Alexander had supplied a draught to the
men all round. This deed I commend above all others,
as it exhibits Alexander’s power of endurance as well as
his wonderful tact in the management of an army.</p>

<p>The army met also with the following adventure in
this country. The guides, becoming uncertain of the
way, at last declared that they could no longer recognise
it, because all its tracks had been obliterated by the sands
which the wind blew over them. Amid the deep sands,
moreover, which had been everywhere heaped up to a
uniform level, nothing rose up from which they could
conjecture their path, not even the usual fringe of trees,
nor so much as the sure landmark of a hill-crest. Nor
had they practised the art of finding their way by observation
of the stars by night or of the sun by day, as
sailors do by watching one or other of the Bears—the
Phoenicians the Lesser Bear, and all other nations the
Greater. Alexander, at last perceiving that he should
direct his march to the left, rode away forward, taking a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
small party of horsemen with him. But when their horses
were tired out by the heat, he left most of his escort
behind, and rode on with only five men and found the sea.
Having scraped away the shingle on the beach, he found
water, both fresh and pure, and then went back and
brought his whole army to this place. And for seven
days they marched along the sea-coast, and procured
water from the beach. As the guides by this time knew
the way, he led his expedition thence into the interior
parts.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXVII.—Appointment of satraps—Alexander
learns that the satrap Philippos had been murdered
in India—Punishes satraps who had misgoverned</i></h5>

<p>When he arrived at the capital of the Gadrôsians he
then gave his army a rest. Apollophanês he deposed
from his satrapy because he found out that he had utterly
disregarded his instructions. He appointed Thoas to be
satrap over the people of this district, but, as he took ill
and died, Siburtios received the vacant office. The same
man had also recently been appointed by Alexander
satrap of Karmania, but now the government of the
Arachotians and Gadrôsians was committed to him, and
Tlêpolemos, the son of Pythophanês, got Karmania. The
king was already advancing into Karmania when tidings
reached him that Philippos, the satrap of the Indian
country, had been plotted against by the mercenaries and
treacherously murdered; but that the Macedonian bodyguards
of Philippos had put to death his murderers whom
they had caught in the very act, and others whom they
had afterwards seized. On learning what had occurred
he sent a letter to India addressed to Eudêmos and
Taxilês directing them to assume the administration of
the province previously governed by Philippos until he
could send a satrap to govern it.</p>

<p>When he arrived in Karmania, Krateros joined him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
bringing the rest of the army and the elephants. He
brought also Ordanês, whom he had made prisoner for
revolting and attempting to make a revolution. Thither
came also Stasanôr, the satrap of the Areians and
Zarangians, accompanied by Pharismanes, the son of
Phrataphernês, the satrap of the Parthyaians and Hyrkanians.
There came besides the generals who had been
left with Parmenion over the army in Media, Kleander and
Sitalkês and Hêrakôn, who brought with them the greater
part of their army. Against Kleander and Sitalkês both
the natives and the soldiers themselves brought many
accusations, as that they had pillaged temples, despoiled
ancient tombs, and perpetrated other outrageous acts of
injustice and tyranny against their subjects. When these
charges were proved against them, he put them to death,
to make others who might be left as satraps, or governors,
or chiefs of districts, stand in fear of suffering a like
punishment if they violated their duty. This was the
means which above all others served to keep in due order
and obedience the nations which Alexander had conquered
in war or which had voluntarily submitted to him, numerous
as they were, and so far remote from each other,
because under his sceptre the ruled were not allowed to
be unjustly treated by their rulers. Hêrakôn on this
occasion was acquitted of the charge, but was soon afterwards
punished, because he was convicted by the men
of Sousa of having plundered the temple of their
city. Stasanôr and Phrataphernês in setting out to join
Alexander, took with them a multitude of beasts of
burden and many camels, because they learned that he
was taking the route through the Gadrôsians, and conjectured
that his army would suffer, as it actually did.
These men arrived therefore very opportunely, as did also
their camels and their beasts of burden. For Alexander
distributed all these animals to the officers one by one, to
the squadrons and centuries of the cavalry, and to the
companies of the infantry as far as their number
sufficed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter XXVIII.—Alexander holds rejoicings in Karmania
on account of his Indian victories—List of his body-guards—Nearchos
reports to him the safety of the
fleet</i></h5>

<p>Some authors have recorded, though I cannot believe
what they state, that he made his progress through
Karmania stretched at length with his companions on
two covered waggons joined together, enjoying the while
the music of the flute, and followed by the soldiers
crowned with garlands and making holiday. They say
also that food and all kinds of good cheer were provided
for them along the roads by the Karmanians, and that
these things were done by Alexander in imitation of the
Bacchic revelry of Dionysos, because it was said of that
deity that, after conquering the Indians, he traversed,
in this manner, a great part of Asia, and received the
name of Thriambos in addition to that of Dionysos, and
that for this very reason the splendid processions in
honour of victories in war were called <i>Thriamboi</i>.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> But
neither Ptolemy, the son of Lagos, nor Aristoboulos has
mentioned these doings in their narratives, nor any other
writer whose testimony on such subjects it would be safe
to trust, and as for myself I have done enough in recording
them as unworthy of belief. But in the account I now
proceed to offer I follow Aristoboulos. In Karmania
Alexander offered sacrifice in thanksgiving to the gods
for his victory over the Indians, and the preservation of
his army during its march through Gadrôsia. He celebrated
also a musical and a gymnastic contest. He then
appointed Peukestas to be one of his body-guards, having
already resolved to make him the satrap of Persis. He
wished him, before his promotion to the satrapy, to
experience this honour and mark of confidence for
the service he rendered among the Malloi. Up to this
time the number of his body-guards was seven—Leonnatos,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
the son of Anteas; Hêphastiôn, the son of Amyntôr;
Lysimachos, the son of Agathoklês; Aristonous, the son
of Peisaios, who were all Pellaians; Perdikkas, the son of
Orontês from Orestis; Ptolemy, the son of Lagos, and
Peithôn, the son of Krateuas, who were both Heordaians—Peukestas,
who had held the shield over Alexander,
was added to them as an eighth.</p>

<p>At this time Nearchos, having sailed round the coast
of Ora and Gadrôsia, and that of the Ichthyophagoi, put
into port in the inhabited parts of the Karmanian coast,
and going up thence into the interior with a few followers
related to Alexander the incidents of the voyage which
he had made for him in the outer sea. He was sent
down again to sea, to sail round to the land of the
Sousians and the outlets of the river Tigris. How he
sailed from the river Indus to the Persian Sea and the
mouth of the Tigris, I shall describe in a separate work,
wherein I shall follow Nearchos himself, as the history
which he composed in the Greek language had Alexander
for its subject. Perhaps at some future time I shall
produce this work if my own inclination and the deity
prompt me to the task.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Eighth Book</span></h4>

<h5><i>Chapter IX.—Description of India</i></h5>

<p>Alexander, not to foster repose which naturally sets
rumours in circulation, advanced towards India, always
adding more to his glory by warfare than by his acts
after victory.</p>

<p>India lies almost entirely towards the east,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> and it is
of less extent in breadth than in length.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The southern
parts rise in hills of considerable elevation.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The country is
elsewhere level, and hence many famous rivers which rise
in Mount Caucasus traverse the plains with languid
currents. The Indus is colder than the other rivers, and
its waters differ but little in colour from those of the sea.
The Ganges, which is the greatest of all rivers in the east,
flows down to the south country, and running in a straight
bed washes great mountain-chains until a barrier of rocks
diverts its course towards the east. Both rivers enter the
Red Sea.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> The Indus wears away its banks, absorbing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
into its waters great numbers of trees and much of
the soil. It is besides obstructed with rocks by which it
is frequently beaten back. Where it finds the soil soft
and yielding it spreads out into pools and forms islands.
The Acesines increases its volume. The Ganges, in running
downward to the sea, intercepts the Iomanes,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and
the two streams dash against each other with great
violence. The Ganges in fact presents a rough face to
the entrance of its affluent, the waters of which though
beaten back in eddies, hold their own.</p>

<p>The Dyardanes is less frequently mentioned, as it
flows through the remotest parts of India. But it breeds
not only crocodiles, like the Nile, but dolphins also, and
various aquatic monsters unknown to other nations.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The
Ethimanthus, which curves time after time in frequent
maeanders, is used up for irrigation by the people on its
banks. Hence it contributes to the sea but a small and
nameless residue of its waters.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The country is everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
intersected with many rivers besides these, but
they are obscure, their course being too short to bring
them into prominent notice. The maritime tracts, however,
are most parched up by the north wind. This wind
is prevented by the mountain-summits from penetrating
to the interior parts, which for this reason are mild and
nourish the crops.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> But so completely has nature altered
the regular changes of the season in these regions that, when
other countries are basking under the hot rays of the sun,
India is covered with snow; and on the other hand, when
the world elsewhere is frost-bound, India is oppressed with
intolerable heat. The reason why nature has thus inverted
her order is not apparent; the sea, at any rate, by
which India is washed does not differ in colour from
other seas. It takes its name from King Erythrus,
and hence ignorant people believe that its waters are
red.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The soil produces flax from which the dress ordinarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
worn by the natives is made.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The tender side of the
barks of trees receives written characters like paper.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
The birds can be readily trained to imitate the sounds of
human speech.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The animals except those imported are
unknown among other nations. The same country yields
fit food for the rhinoceros, but this animal is not
indigenous.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The elephants are more powerful than those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
tamed in Africa, and their size corresponds to their
strength.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Gold is carried down by several rivers, whose
loitering waters glide with slow and gentle currents.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
The sea casts upon the shores precious stones and pearls,
nor has anything contributed more to the opulence of the
natives, especially since they spread the community of
evil to foreign nations; for these offscourings of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
boiling sea are valued at the price which fashion sets on
coveted luxuries.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>The character of the people is here, as elsewhere,
formed by the position of their country and its climate.
They cover their persons down to the feet with fine
muslin, are shod with sandals,<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and coil round their
heads cloths of linen (cotton). They hang precious
stones as pendants from their ears, and persons of high
social rank, or of great wealth, deck their wrist and upper
arm with bracelets of gold. They frequently comb, but
seldom cut, the hair of their head. The beard of the
chin they never cut at all, but they shave off the hair
from the rest of the face, so that it looks polished.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> The
luxury of their kings, or as they call it, their magnificence,
is carried to a vicious excess without a parallel in
the world.</p>

<p>When the king condescends to show himself in public
his attendants carry in their hands silver censers, and
perfume with incense all the road by which it is his
pleasure to be conveyed. He lolls in a golden palanquin,
garnished with pearls, which dangle all round it, and he
is robed in fine muslin embroidered with purple and gold.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
Behind his palanquin follow men-at-arms and his bodyguards,
of whom some carry boughs of trees, on which
birds are perched trained to interrupt business with their
cries.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The palace is adorned with gilded pillars clasped
all round by a vine embossed in gold, while silver images
of those birds which most charm the eye diversify the
workmanship. The palace is open to all comers even
when the king is having his hair combed and dressed.
It is then that he gives audience to ambassadors, and
administers justice to his subjects. His slippers being after
this taken off, his feet are rubbed with scented ointments.
His principal exercise is hunting; amid the vows and
songs of his courtesans he shoots the game enclosed
within the royal park. The arrows, which are two cubits
long, are discharged with more effort than effect, for
though the force of these missiles depends on their lightness
they are loaded with an obnoxious weight. He rides
on horseback when making short journeys, but when
bound on a distant expedition he rides in a chariot
(howdah) mounted on elephants, and, huge as these
animals are, their bodies are covered completely over
with trappings of gold. That no form of shameless
profligacy may be wanting, he is accompanied by a
long train of courtesans carried in golden palanquins,
and this troop holds a separate place in the procession
from the queen’s retinue, and is as sumptuously appointed.
His food is prepared by women, who also
serve him with wine, which is much used by all the
Indians. When the king falls into a drunken sleep his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
courtesans carry him away to his bedchamber, invoking
the gods of the night in their native hymns.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Amid this corruption of morals who would expect to
find the culture of philosophy? Notwithstanding, they
have men whom they call philosophers, of whom one
class lives in the woods and fields, and is extremely
uncouth. These think it glorious to anticipate the hour
of destiny, and arrange to have themselves burned alive
when age has destroyed their activity, or the failure of
health has made life burdensome. They regard death if
waited for as a disgrace to their life, and when dissolution
is simply the effect of old age funeral honours are denied
to the dead body. They think that the fire is polluted
unless the pyre receives the body before the breath has
yet left it.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Those philosophers again who lead a civilised
life in cities are said to observe the motions of the
heavenly bodies, and to predict future events on scientific
principles. These believe that no one accelerates
the day of his death who can without fear await its
coming.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>They regard as gods whatever objects they value,
especially trees, to violate which is a capital offence.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
Their months they make to consist each of fifteen days,
but they nevertheless assign to the year its full duration.
They mark the divisions of time by the course of the
moon, not like most nations when that planet shows a
full face, but when she begins to appear horned, and
hence, by fixing the duration of a month to correspond
with this phase of the moon, they have their months one-half
shorter than the months of other people.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Many
other things have been related of them, but to interrupt
with them the progress of the narrative I consider quite
out of place.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter X.—Campaign in the regions west of the Indus—Alexander
captures Nysa, and visits Mount Merus—Siege
of Mazaga, and its surrender</i></h5>

<p>Alexander had no sooner entered India than the chiefs
of various tribes came to meet him with proffers of service.
He was, they said, the third descendant of Jupiter
who had visited their country, and that while Father
Bacchus and Hercules were known to them merely by
tradition, him they saw present before their eyes. To
these he accorded a gracious reception, and intending to
employ them as his guides, he bade them to accompany
him. But when no more chiefs came to surrender, he
despatched Hephaestion and Perdiccas in advance with a
part of his army to reduce whatever tribes declined his
authority. He ordered them to proceed to the Indus
and build boats for transporting the army to the other
side of that river. Since many rivers would have to be
crossed, they so constructed the vessels that, after being
taken to pieces, the sections could be conveyed in waggons,
and be again pieced together. He himself, leaving
Craterus to follow with the infantry, pressed forward with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
the cavalry and light troops, and falling in with the
enemy easily routed them, and chased them into the
nearest city. Craterus had now rejoined him, and the
king, wishing to strike terror into this people, who had
not yet proved the Macedonian arms, gave previous orders
that when the fortifications of the city under siege had
been burned, not a soul was to be left alive. Now, in
riding up to the walls he was wounded by an arrow, but
he captured the place, and having massacred all the
inhabitants, vented his rage even upon the buildings.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>Having conquered this obscure tribe, he moved thence
towards the city of Nysa. The camp, it so happened,
was pitched under the walls on woody ground, and as the
cold at night was more piercing than had ever before
been felt, it made the soldiers shiver. But they were
fortunate enough to have at hand the means of making
a fire, for felling the copses they kindled a flame, and fed
it with faggots, so that it seized the tombs of the citizens,
which, being made of old cedar wood, spread the fire they
had caught in all directions till every tomb was burned
down. The barking of dogs was now heard from the
town, followed by the clamour of human voices <i>from the
camp</i>. Thus the citizens discovered that the enemy had
arrived, and the Macedonians that they were close to the
city.</p>

<p>The king had now drawn out his forces and was
assaulting the walls, when some of the defenders risked
an engagement. These were, however, overpowered with
darts, so that dissensions broke out among the Nysaeans,
some advising submission, but others the trial of a battle.
Alexander, on discovering that their opinions were divided,
instituted a close blockade, but forbade further bloodshed.</p>

<p>After a while they surrendered, unable to endure longer
the miseries of a blockade. Their city, so they asserted,
was founded by Father Bacchus, and this was in fact its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
origin. It was situated at the foot of a mountain which
the inhabitants call Meros, whence the Greeks took the
license of coining the fable that Father Bacchus had been
concealed in the thigh of Jupiter. The king learned from
the inhabitants where the mountain lay, and sending
provisions on before, climbed to its summit with his whole
army.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> There they saw the ivy-plant and the vine
growing in great luxuriance all over the mountain, and
perennial waters gushing from its slopes. The juices of
the fruits were various and wholesome since the soil
favoured the growth of chance-sown seeds, and even the
crags were frequently overhung with thickets of laurel
and spikenard. I attribute it not to any divine impulse,
but to wanton folly, that they wreathed their brows with
chaplets of gathered ivy and vine-leaves, and roved at
large through the woods like bacchanals; so that, when
the folly initiated by a few had, as usually happens,
suddenly infected the whole multitude,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> the slopes and
peaks of the mountain rang with the shouts of thousands
paying their homage to the guardian divinity of the grove.
Nay, they even flung themselves down full length on the
greensward, or on heaps of leaves as if peace reigned all
around. The king himself, so far from looking askance at
this extemporaneous revel, supplied with a liberal hand all
kinds of viands for feasting, and kept the army engaged for
ten days in celebrating the orgies of Father Bacchus. Who
then can deny that even distinguished glory is a boon for
which mortals are oftener indebted to fortune than to
merit, seeing that when they had abandoned themselves
to feasting and were drowsed with wine the enemy had
not even the courage to fall upon them, being terrified no
less by the uproar and howling made by the revellers
than if the shouts of warriors rushing to battle had rung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
in their ears. The like good fortune afterwards protected
them in the presence of their enemies when on returning
from the ocean they gave themselves up to drunken
festivity.</p>

<p>From Nysa they came to a region called Daedala.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
The inhabitants had deserted their habitations and fled
for safety to the trackless recesses of their mountain
forests. He therefore passed on to Acadira, which he
found burned, and like Daedala deserted by the flight of
the inhabitants. Necessity made him therefore change
his plan of operations. For having divided his forces
he showed his arms at many points at once, and the
inhabitants taken by surprise were overwhelmed with
calamities of every kind. Ptolemy took a greater number
of cities, and Alexander himself those that were more
important. This done, he again drew together his
scattered forces. Having next crossed the river Choaspes,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
he left Coenus to besiege an opulent city—the inhabitants
called it Beira<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>—while he himself went on to Mazaga.</p>

<p>Assacanus, its previous sovereign, had lately died, and
his mother Cleophis now ruled the city and the realm.
An army of 38,000 infantry defended the city which was
strongly fortified both by nature and art. For on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
east, an impetuous mountain-stream with steep banks on
both sides barred approach to the city, while to south and
west nature, as if designing to form a rampart, had piled
up gigantic rocks, at the base of which lay sloughs and
yawning chasms hollowed in the course of ages to vast
depths, while a ditch of mighty labour drawn from their
extremity continued the line of defence. The city was
besides surrounded with a wall 35 stadia in circumference
which had a basis of stonework supporting a superstructure
of unburnt, sun-dried bricks. The brick-work
was bound into a solid fabric by means of stones so
interposed that the more brittle material rested upon the
harder, while moist clay had been used for mortar. Lest,
however, the structure should all at once sink, strong
beams had been laid upon these, supporting wooden floors
which covered the walls and afforded a passage along
them.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Alexander while reconnoitring the fortifications, and
unable to fix on a plan of attack, since nothing less than
a vast mole, necessary for bringing up his engines to the
walls, would suffice to fill up the chasms, was wounded
from the ramparts by an arrow which chanced to hit him
in the calf of the leg. When the barb was extracted, he
called for his horse, and without having his wound so
much as bandaged, continued with unabated energy to prosecute
the work on hand. But when the injured limb was
hanging without support, and the gradual cooling, as the
blood dried, aggravated the pain, he is reported to have
said that though he was called, as all knew, the son of
Jupiter, he felt notwithstanding all the defects of the weak
body.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> He did not, however, return to the camp till he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
had viewed every thing and ordered what he wanted to
be done. Accordingly some of the soldiers began, as
directed, to destroy the houses outside the city and to
take from the ruins much material for raising a mole,
while others cast into the hollows large trunks of trees,
branches and all, together with great masses of rock.
When the mole had now been raised to a level with the
surface of the ground, they proceeded to erect towers; and
so zealously did the soldiers prosecute the works, that
they finished them completely within nine days. These
the king, before his wound had as yet closed, proceeded
to inspect. He commended the troops, and then from
the engines which he had ordered to be propelled a great
storm of missiles was discharged against the defenders on
the ramparts. What had most effect in intimidating the
barbarians was the spectacle of the movable towers, for to
works of that description they were utter strangers.
Those vast fabrics moving without visible aid, they
believed to be propelled by the agency of the gods.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> It
was impossible, they said, that those javelins for attacking
walls—those ponderous darts hurled from engines could
be within the compass of mortal power. Giving up therefore
the defence as hopeless, they withdrew into the
citadel, whence, as nothing but to surrender was open to
the besieged, they sent down envoys to the king to sue
for pardon.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> This being granted, the queen came with a
great train of noble ladies who poured out libations of
wine from golden bowls. The queen herself, having
placed her son, still a child, at Alexander’s knees, obtained
not only pardon, but permission to retain her former
dignity, for she was styled queen, and some have believed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
that this indulgent treatment was accorded rather to the
charms of her person than to pity for her misfortunes.
At all events she afterwards gave birth to a son who
received the name of Alexander, whoever his father may
have been.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XI.—Siege and capture of the Rock Aornis</i></h5>

<p>Polypercon being despatched hence with an army to
the city of Nora, defeated the undisciplined multitude
which he encountered, and pursuing them within their
fortifications compelled them to surrender the place.
Into the king’s own hands there fell many inconsiderable
towns, deserted by their inhabitants who had escaped in
time with their arms and seized a rock called Aornis. A
report was current that this stronghold had been in vain
assaulted by Hercules, who had been compelled by an
earthquake to raise the siege. The rock being on all
sides steep and rugged, Alexander was at a loss how to
proceed, when there came to him an elderly man familiar
with the locality accompanied by two sons, offering, if
Alexander would make it worth his while, to show him a
way of access to the summit. Alexander agreed to give
him eighty talents, and, keeping one of his sons as a
hostage, sent him to make good his offer. Mullinus
(Eumenês?), the king’s secretary, was put in command of
the light-armed men, for these, as had been decided, were
to climb to the summit by a detour, to prevent their being
seen by the enemy.</p>

<p>This rock does not, like most eminences, grow up to
its towering top by gradual and easy acclivities, but rises
up straight just like the <i>meta</i>, which from a wide base
tapers off in ascending till it terminates in a sharp
pinnacle.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The river Indus, here very deep and enclosed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
between rugged banks, washes its roots. In another
quarter are swamps and craggy ravines; and only by
filling up these could an assault upon the stronghold be
rendered practicable. A wood which was contiguous the
king directed to be cut down. The trees where they fell
were stripped of their leaves and branches which would
otherwise have proved an impediment to their transport.
He himself threw in the first trunk, whereupon followed a
loud cheer from the army, a token of its alacrity, no one
refusing a labour to which the king was the first to put
his hand. Within the seventh day they had filled up the
hollows, and then the king directed the archers and the
Agrianians to struggle up the steep ascent. He selected
besides from his personal staff<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> thirty of the most active
among the young men, whom he placed under the
command of Charus and Alexander. The latter he
reminded of the name which he bore in common with
himself.</p>

<p>And at first, because the peril was so palpable, a
resolution was passed that the king should not hazard his
safety by taking part in the assault.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> But when the
trumpet sounded the signal, the audacious prince at once
turned to his body-guards, and bidding them to follow
was the first to assail the rock. None of the Macedonians
then held back, but all spontaneously left their posts and
followed the king. Many perished by a dismal fate, for
they fell from the shelving crags and were engulfed in the
river which flowed underneath—a piteous sight even for
those who were not themselves in danger. But when
reminded by the destruction of their comrades what they
had to dread for themselves, their pity changed to fear,
and they began to lament not for the dead but for
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>And now they had attained a point whence they could
not return without disaster unless victorious, for as the
barbarians rolled down massive stones upon them while
they climbed, such as were struck fell headlong from their
insecure and slippery positions. Alexander and Charus,
however, whom the king had sent in advance with the
thirty chosen men, reached the summit, and had by this
time engaged in a hand-to-hand fight; but since the
barbarians discharged their darts from higher ground, the
assailants received more wounds than they inflicted. So
then Alexander, mindful alike of his name and his promise,
in fighting with more spirit than judgment, fell
pierced with many darts. Charus, seeing him lying dead,
made a rush upon the enemy, caring for nothing but
revenge. Many received their death from his spear and
others from his sword. But as he was single-handed
against overwhelming odds, he sank lifeless on the body
of his friend.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>The king, duly affected by the death of these heroic
youths and the other soldiers, gave the signal for retiring.
It conduced to the safety of the troops that they retreated
leisurely, preserving their coolness, and that the barbarians,
satisfied with having driven them down hill, did
not close on them when they withdrew. But, though
Alexander had resolved to abandon the enterprise, deeming
the capture of the rock hopeless, he still made
demonstrations of persevering with the siege, for by his
orders the avenues were blocked, the towers advanced,
and the working parties relieved when tired. The Indians,
on seeing his pertinacity, by way of demonstrating not
only their confidence but their triumph, devoted two days
and nights to festivity and beating their national music
out of their drums. But on the third night the rattle
of the drums ceased to be heard. Torches, however,
which, as the night was dark, the barbarians had lighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
to make their flight safer down the precipitous crags, shed
their glare over every part of the rocks.</p>

<p>The king learned from Balacrus, who had been sent
forward to reconnoitre, that the Indians had fled and
abandoned the rock. He thereupon gave a signal that
his men should raise a general shout, and he thus struck
terror into the fugitives as they were making off in disorder.
Then many, as if the enemy were already upon
them, flung themselves headlong over the slippery rocks
and precipices and perished, while a still greater number,
who were hurt, were left to their fate by those who had
descended without accident. Although it was the position
rather than the enemy he had conquered, the king gave to
this success the appearance of a great victory by offering
sacrifices and worship to the gods. Upon the rock he erected
altars dedicated to Minerva and Victory. To the guides
who had shown the way to the light-armed detachment
which had been sent to scale the rock he honourably paid
the stipulated recompense, even although their performance
had fallen short of their promises. The defence of
the rock and the country surrounding was entrusted to
Sisocostus.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XII.—Alexander marches to the Indus, crosses it,
and is hospitably received by Omphis, King of Taxila</i></h5>

<p>Thence he marched towards Embolima, but on learning
that the pass which led thereto was occupied by 20,000
men in arms under Erix,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> he hurried forward himself with
the archers and slingers, leaving the heavy-armed troops
under the command of Coenus to advance leisurely.
Having dislodged those men who beset the defile, he
cleared the passage for the army which followed. The
Indians, either from disaffection to their chief or to court
the favour of the conqueror, set upon Erix during his
flight and killed him. They brought his head and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
armour to Alexander, who did not punish them for their
crime, but to condemn their example gave them no
reward. Having left this pass, he arrived after the sixteenth
encampment at the river Indus, where he found
that Hephaestion, agreeably to his orders, had made all
the necessary preparations for the passage across it.</p>

<p>The sovereign of the territories on the other side was
Omphis,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> who had urged his father to surrender his kingdom
to Alexander, and had moreover at his father’s
death sent envoys to enquire whether it was Alexander’s
pleasure that he should meanwhile exercise authority or
remain in a private capacity till his arrival. He was permitted
to assume the sovereignty, but modestly forbore to
exercise its functions. He had extended to Hephaestion
marks of civility, and given corn gratuitously to his
soldiers, but he had not gone to join him, from a reluctance
to make trial of the good faith of any but Alexander.
Accordingly, on Alexander’s approach, he went to meet
him at the head of an army equipped for the field. He
had even brought his elephants with him, which, posted
at short intervals amidst the ranks of the soldiery,
appeared to the distant spectator like towers.</p>

<p>Alexander at first thought it was not a friendly but a
hostile army that approached, and had already ordered
the soldiers to arm themselves, and the cavalry to divide
to the wings, and was ready for action. But the Indian
prince, on seeing the mistake of the Macedonians, put his
horse to the gallop, leaving orders that no one else was to
stir from his place. Alexander likewise galloped forward,
not knowing whether it was an enemy or a friend he had
to encounter, but trusting for safety perhaps to his valour,
perhaps to the other’s good faith. They met in a friendly
spirit, as far as could be gathered from the expression of
each one’s face, but from the want of an interpreter to
converse was impossible. An interpreter was therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
procured, and then the barbarian prince explained that he
had come with his army to meet Alexander that he
might at once place at his disposal all the forces of his
empire, without waiting to tender his allegiance through
deputies. He surrendered, he said, his person and his
kingdom to a man who, as he knew, was fighting not more
for fame than fearing to incur the reproach of perfidy.</p>

<p>The king, pleased with the simple honesty of the
barbarian, gave him his right hand as a pledge of his own
good faith, and confirmed him in his sovereignty. The
prince had brought with him six-and-fifty elephants, and
these he gave to Alexander, with a great many sheep of
an extraordinary size, and 3000 bulls of a valuable breed,
highly prized by the rulers of the country. When Alexander
asked him whether he had more husbandmen or
soldiers, he replied that as he was at war with two kings
he required more soldiers than field labourers. These
kings were Abisares and Porus, but Porus was superior in
power and influence. Both of them held sway beyond
the river Hydaspes, and had resolved to try the fortune of
war whatever invader might come.</p>

<p>Omphis, under Alexander’s permission, and according
to the usage of the realm, assumed the ensigns of royalty
along with the name which his father had borne. His
people called him Taxiles, for such was the name which
accompanied the sovereignty, on whomsoever it devolved.
When, therefore, he had entertained Alexander for three
days with lavish hospitality, he showed him on the fourth
day what quantity of corn he had supplied to Hephaestion’s
troops, and then presented him and all his friends
with golden crowns, and eighty talents besides of coined
silver. Alexander was so exceedingly gratified with this
profuse generosity that he not only sent back to Omphis the
presents he had given, but added a thousand talents from
the spoils which he carried, along with many banqueting
vessels of gold and silver, a vast quantity of Persian
drapery, and thirty chargers from his own stalls, caparisoned
as when ridden by himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>This liberality, while it bound the barbarian to his
interests, gave at the same time the deepest offence to his
own friends. One of them, Meleager, who had taken too
much wine at supper, said that he congratulated Alexander
on having found in India, if nowhere else, some one
worthy of a thousand talents. The king, who had not
forgotten what remorse he had suffered when he killed
Clitus for audacity of speech, controlled his temper, but
remarked that envious persons were nothing but their
own tormentors.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XIII.—Alexander and Porus confront each other on
opposite banks of the Hydaspes</i></h5>

<p>On the following day envoys from Abisares reached
the king, and, as they had been instructed, surrendered to
him all that their master possessed. After pledges of
good faith had been interchanged, they were sent back to
their sovereign. Alexander, thinking that by the mere
prestige of his name Porus also would be induced to
surrender, sent Cleochares to tell him in peremptory
terms that he must pay tribute and come to meet his
sovereign at the very frontiers of his own dominions.
Porus answered that he would comply with the second of
these demands, and when Alexander entered his realm he
would meet him, but come armed for battle. Alexander
had now resolved to cross the Hydaspes, when Barzaentes,
who had instigated the Arachosians to revolt, was brought
to him in chains, along with thirty captured elephants, an
opportune reinforcement against the Indians, since these
huge beasts more than the soldiery constituted the hope
and main strength of an Indian army.</p>

<p>Samaxus was also brought in chains, the king of a
small Indian state, who had espoused the cause of
Barzaentes. Alexander having then put the traitor and
his accomplice under custody, and consigned the elephants
to the care of Taxiles, advanced till he reached the river<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
Hydaspes, where on the further bank Porus had encamped
to prevent the enemy from landing. In the van of his
army he had posted 85 elephants of the greatest size and
strength, and behind these 300 chariots and somewhere
about 30,000 infantry, among whom were the archers,
whose arrows, as already stated, were too ponderous to
be readily discharged. He was himself mounted on an
elephant which towered above all its fellows, while his
armour, embellished with gold and silver, set off his
supremely majestic person to great advantage. His
courage matched his bodily vigour, and his wisdom was
the utmost attainable in a rude community.</p>

<p>The Macedonians were intimidated not only by the
appearance of the enemy, but by the magnitude of the
river to be crossed, which, spreading out to a width of no
less than four stadia in a deep channel which nowhere
opened a passage by fords, presented the aspect of a
vast sea. Yet its rapidity did not diminish in proportion
to its wider diffusion, but it rushed impetuously like a
seething torrent compressed into a narrow bed by the
closing in of its banks. Besides, at many points the
presence of sunken rocks was revealed where the waves
were driven back in eddies. The bank presented a still
more formidable aspect, for, as far as the eye could see,
it was covered with cavalry and infantry, in the midst of
which, like so many massive structures, stood the huge
elephants, which, being of set purpose provoked by their
drivers, distressed the ear with their frightful roars. The
enemy and the river both in their front, struck with
sudden dismay the hearts of the Macedonians, disposed
though they were to entertain good hopes, and knowing
from experience against what fearful odds they had ere now
contended. They could not believe that boats so unhandy
could be steered to the bank or gain it in safety. In the
middle of the river were numerous islands to which both
the Indians and Macedonians began to swim over, holding
their weapons above their heads. Here they would
engage in skirmishes, while each king endeavoured from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
the result of these minor conflicts to gauge the issue of
the final struggle. In the Macedonian army were
Symmachus and Nicanor, both young men of noble
lineage, distinguished for their hardihood and enterprise,
and from the uniform success of their side in whatever
they assayed, inspired with a contempt for every kind of
danger. Led by these, a party of the boldest youths,
equipped with nothing but lances, swam over to the island
when it was occupied by crowds of the enemy.</p>

<p>Armed with audacious courage, the best of all weapons,
they slew many of the Indians, and might have retired
with glory if temerity when successful could ever keep
within bounds. But while with contempt and pride they
waited till succours reached the enemy, they were surrounded
by men who had unperceived swum over to the
island, and were overthrown by discharges of missiles.
Such as escaped the enemy were either swept away by
the force of the current or swallowed up in its eddies.
This fight exalted the confidence of Porus, who had
witnessed from the bank all its vicissitudes.</p>

<p>Alexander, perplexed how to cross the river, at last
devised a plan for duping the enemy. In the river lay
an island larger than the rest, wooded and suitable for
concealing an ambuscade. A deep hollow, moreover,
which lay not far from the bank in his own occupation,
was capable of hiding not only foot-soldiers but mounted
cavalry. To divert, therefore, the attention of the enemy
from a place possessing such advantages, he ordered
Ptolemy with all his squadrons of horse to ride up and
down at a distance from the island in view of the enemy,
and now and then to alarm the Indians by shouting, as if
he meant to make the passage of the river.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> For several
days Ptolemy repeated this feint, and thus obliged Porus
to concentrate his troops at the point which he pretended
to threaten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>The island was now beyond view of the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
Alexander then gave orders that his own tent should be
pitched on a part of the bank looking the other way,
that the guard of honour which usually attended him
should be posted before it, and that all the pageantry of
royal state should be paraded before the eyes of the
enemy on purpose to deceive them. He besides requested
Attalus, who was about his own age, and not
unlike him in form and feature, especially when seen
from a distance, to wear the royal mantle, and so make
it appear as if the king in person was guarding that
part of the bank without any intention of crossing the
river. The state of the weather at first hindered, but
afterwards favoured, the execution of this design, fortune
making even untoward circumstances turn out to his
ultimate advantage. For when the enemy was busy
watching the troops under Ptolemy which occupied the
bank lower down, and Alexander with the rest of his
forces was making ready to cross the river and reach
the land over against the island already mentioned, a
storm poured down torrents of rain, against which even
those under cover could scarcely protect themselves.
The soldiers, overcome by the fury of the elements,
deserted the boats and ships, and fled back for safety to
land, but the din occasioned by their hurry and confusion
could not be heard by the enemy amid the roar of the
tempest. All of a sudden the rain then ceased, but
clouds so dense overspread the sky that they hid the
light, and made it scarcely possible for men conversing
together to see each other’s faces.</p>

<p>Any other leader but Alexander would have been
appalled by the darkness drawn over the face of heaven
just when he was starting on a voyage across an unknown
river, with the enemy perhaps guarding the very bank to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
which his men were blindly and imprudently directing
their course. But the king deriving glory from danger
and regarding the darkness which terrified others as his
opportunity, gave the signal that all should embark in
silence, and ordered that the galley which carried himself
should be the first to be run aground on the other side.
The bank, however, towards which they steered was not
occupied by the enemy, for Porus was in fact still intently
watching Ptolemy only. Hence all the ships made the
passage in safety except just one, which stuck on a rock
whither it had been driven by the wind. Alexander
then ordered the soldiers to take their arms and to fall
into their ranks.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XIV.—Battle with Porus on the left bank of the
Hydaspes—Porus being defeated surrenders</i></h5>

<p>He was already in full march at the head of his army,
which he had divided into two columns, when the tidings
reached Porus that the bank was occupied by a military
force, and that the crisis of his fortunes was now imminent.
In keeping with the infirmity of our nature, which makes
us ever hope the best, he at first indulged the belief that
this was his ally Abisares come to help him in the war as
had been agreed upon. But soon after, when the sky
had become clearer, and showed the ranks to be those of
the enemy, he sent 100 chariots and 4000 horse to
obstruct their advance. The command of this detachment
he gave to his brother Hages.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Its main strength
lay in the chariots, each of which was drawn by four
horses and carried six men, of whom two were shield-bearers,
two, archers posted on each side of the chariot,
and the other two, charioteers, as well as men-at-arms,
for when the fighting was at close-quarters they dropped
the reins and hurled dart after dart against the enemy.</p>

<p>But on this particular day these chariots proved to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
scarcely of any service, for the storm of rain, which, as
already said, was of extraordinary violence, had made
the ground slippery, and unfit for horses to ride over,
while the chariots kept sticking in the muddy sloughs
formed by the rain, and proved almost immovable from
their great weight. Alexander, on the other hand, charged
with the utmost vigour, because his troops were lightly
armed and unencumbered. The Scythians and Dahae
first of all attacked the Indians, and then the king
launched Perdiccas with his horse upon their right wing.
The fighting had now become hot everywhere, when the
drivers of the chariots rode at full speed into the midst of
the battle, thinking they could thus most effectively
succour their friends. It would be hard to say which
side suffered most from this charge, for the Macedonian
foot-soldiers, who were exposed to the first shock of the
onset, were trampled down, while the charioteers were
hurled from their seats, when the chariots in rushing into
action jolted over broken and slippery ground. Some
again of the horses took fright and precipitated the
carriages not only into the sloughs and pools of water,
but even into the river itself.</p>

<p>A few which were driven off the field by the darts of
the enemy made their way to Porus, who was making
most energetic preparations for the contest. As soon as
he saw his chariots scattered amid his ranks, and wandering
about without their drivers, he distributed his
elephants to his friends who were nearest him. Behind
them he had posted the infantry and the archers and the
men who beat the drums, the instruments which the
Indians use instead of trumpets to produce their war
music. The rattle of these instruments does not in the
least alarm the elephants, their ears, through long familiarity,
being deadened to the sound. An image of
Hercules was borne in front of the line of infantry, and
this acted as the strongest of all incentives to make the
soldiers fight well. To desert the bearers of this image
was reckoned a disgraceful military offence, and they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
even ordained death as a penalty for those who failed to
bring it back from the battlefield, for the dread which the
Indians had conceived for the god when he was their
enemy had been toned down to a feeling of religious awe
and veneration.</p>

<p>The sight not only of the huge beasts, but even of
Porus himself, made the Macedonians pause for a time,
for the beasts, which had been placed at intervals between
the armed ranks, presented, when seen from a distance,
the appearance of towers, and Porus himself not only surpassed
the standard of height to which we conceive the
human figure to be limited, but, besides this, the elephant
on which he was mounted seemed to add to his proportions,
for it towered over all the other elephants even as
Porus himself stood taller than other men. Hence Alexander,
after attentively viewing the king and the army of
the Indians, remarked to those near him, “I see at last a
danger that matches my courage. It is at once with
wild beasts and men of uncommon mettle that the contest
now lies.” Then turning to Coenus, “When I,” he
said, “along with Ptolemy, Perdiccas, and Hephaestion,
have fallen upon the enemy’s left wing, and you see me
in the heat of the conflict, do you then advance the right
wing,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and charge the enemy when their ranks begin to
waver. And you, sirs,” he added, turning to Antigenes,
Leonnatus, and Tauron, “must bear down upon their
centre, and press them hard in front. The formidable
length and strength of our pikes will never be so useful
as when they are directed against these huge beasts and
their drivers. Hurl, then, their riders to the ground, and
stab the beasts themselves. Their assistance is not of a kind
to be depended on, and they may do their own side more
damage than ours, for they are driven against the enemy by
constraint, while terror turns them against their own ranks.”</p>

<p>Having spoken thus he was the first to put spurs to
his horse. And now, as had been arranged, Coenus,
upon seeing that Alexander was at close-quarters with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
the enemy, threw his cavalry with great fury upon their
left wing. The phalanx besides, at the first onset, broke
through the centre of the Indians. But Porus ordered his
elephants to be driven into action where he had seen
cavalry charging his ranks. The slow-footed unwieldy
animals, however, were unfitted to cope with the rapid
movements of horses, and the barbarians were besides
unable to use even their arrows. These weapons were
really so long and heavy that the archers could not
readily adjust them on the string unless by first resting
their bow upon the ground. Then, as the ground was
slippery and hindered their efforts, the enemy had time
to charge them before they could deliver their blows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="figure11">
<img src="images/figure11.jpg" width="500" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.—Indian Bowman.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The king’s authority was in these circumstances unheeded,
and, as usually happens when the ranks are
broken, and fear begins to dictate orders more peremptorily
than the general himself, as many took the command
upon themselves as there were scattered bodies of
troops. Some proposed that these bodies should unite,
others that they should form separate detachments, some
that they should wait to be attacked, others that they
should wheel round and charge the enemy in the rear.
No common plan of action was after all concerted.
Porus, however, with a few friends in whom the sense of
honour was stronger than fear, rallied his scattered forces,
and marching in front of his line advanced against the
enemy with the elephants. These animals inspired
great terror, and their strange dissonant cries frightened
not only the horses, which shy at everything, but the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
also, and disordered the ranks, so that those who just
before were victorious began now to look round them for
a place to which they could flee. Alexander thereupon
despatched against the elephants the lightly-armed Agrianians
and the Thracians, troops more serviceable in
skirmishing than in close combat. They assailed the
elephants and their drivers with a furious storm of missiles,
and the phalanx, on seeing the resulting terror and
confusion, steadily pressed forward.</p>

<p>Some, however, by pursuing too eagerly, so irritated
the animals with wounds that they turned their rage upon
them, and they were in consequence trampled to death
under their feet, thus warning others to attack them with
greater caution. The most dismal of all sights was when
the elephants would, with their trunks, grasp the men,
arms and all, and hoisting them above their heads,
deliver them over into the hands of their drivers. Thus
the battle was doubtful, the Macedonians sometimes pursuing
and sometimes fleeing from the elephants, so that
the struggle was prolonged till the day was far spent.
Then they began to hack the feet of the beasts with axes
which they had prepared for the purpose, having besides
a kind of sword somewhat curved like a scythe, and called
a chopper, wherewith they aimed at their trunks. In
fact, their fear of the animals led them not only to leave
no means untried for killing them, but even for killing
them with unheard-of forms of cruelty.</p>

<p>Hence the elephants, being at last spent with wounds,
spread havoc among their own ranks, and threw their
drivers to the ground, who were then trampled to death
by their own beasts. They were therefore driven from
the field of battle like a flock of sheep, as they were maddened
with terror rather than vicious. Porus, meanwhile,
being left in the lurch by the majority of his men, began
to hurl from his elephant the darts with which he had
beforehand provided himself, and while many were
wounded from afar by his shot he was himself exposed
as a butt for blows from every quarter. He had already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
received nine wounds before and behind, and became so
faint from the great loss of blood that the darts were
dropped rather than flung from his feeble hands. But his
elephant, waxing furious though not yet wounded, kept
charging the ranks of the enemy until the driver, perceiving
the king’s condition—his limbs failing him, his
weapons dropping from his grasp, and his consciousness
almost gone—turned the beast round and fled.</p>

<p>Alexander pursued, but his horse being pierced with
many wounds fainted under him, and sank to the ground,
laying the king down gently rather than throwing him
from his seat.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The necessity of changing his horse
retarded of course his pursuit. In the meantime the
brother of Taxiles, the Indian King whom Alexander
had sent on before, advised Porus not to persist in holding
out to the last extremity, but to surrender himself to
the conqueror.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Porus, however, though his strength was
exhausted, and his blood nearly spent, yet roused himself
at the well-known voice, and said, “I recognise the brother
of Taxiles, who gave up his throne and kingdom.”
Therewith he flung at him the one dart that had not
slipped from his grasp, and flung it too with such force
that it pierced right through his back to his chest.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
Having roused himself to this last effort of valour, he
began to flee faster than before, but his elephant, which
had by this time received many wounds, was now, like
himself, quite exhausted, so that he stopped the flight,
and made head against the pursuers with his remaining
infantry.</p>

<p>Alexander had now come up, and knowing how
obstinate Porus was, forbade quarter to be given to those
who resisted.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The infantry therefore, and Porus himself,
were assailed with darts from all points, and as he could
no longer bear up against them he began to slip from his
elephant. The Indian driver, thinking the king wished
to alight, made the elephant kneel down in the usual
manner. On seeing this the other elephants also knelt
down, for they had been trained to lower themselves
when the royal elephant did so. Porus and his men were
thus placed entirely at the mercy of the conqueror. Alexander,
supposing that he was dead, ordered his body to
be stripped,<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and men then ran forward to take off his
breastplate and robes, when the elephant turned upon
them in defence of its master, and lifting him up placed
him once more on its back.</p>

<p>Upon this the animal was on all sides overwhelmed
with darts, and when it was stabbed to death, Porus was
placed upon a waggon. But the king perceiving him to
lift up his eyes, forgot all animosity, and being deeply
moved with pity, said to him, “What the plague! what
madness induced you to try the fortune of war with me,
of whose exploits you have heard the fame, especially
when in Taxiles you had a near example of my clemency
to those who submit to me?” He answered thus:
“Since you propose a question, I shall answer with the
freedom which you grant by asking it. I used to think
there was no one braver than myself, for I knew my own
strength, but had not yet experienced thine. The result<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
of the war has taught me that you are the braver man,
but even in ranking next to you, I consider myself to be
highly fortunate.” Being asked again how he thought the
victor should treat him, “in accordance,” he replied, “with
the lesson which this day teaches—a day in which you
have witnessed how readily prosperity can be blasted.”</p>

<p>By giving this admonition he gained more than if he
had resorted to entreaty, for Alexander, in consideration
of the greatness of his courage which scorned all fear,
and which adversity could not break down, extended pity
to his misfortunes and honour to his merits.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> He
ordered his wounds to be as carefully attended to as if he
had fought in his service, and when he had recovered
strength, he admitted him into the number of his friends,
and soon after presented him with a larger kingdom
than that which he had.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> And in truth his nature had
no more essential or more permanent quality than a high
respect for true merit and renown; but he estimated
more candidly and impartially glory in an enemy than
in a subject. In fact, he thought that the fabric of his
fame might be pulled down by his own people, while it
could but receive enhanced lustre the greater those were
whom he vanquished.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ninth Book</span></h4>

<h5><i>Chapter I.—Alexander’s speech to his soldiers after the
victory—Abisares sends him an embassy</i></h5>

<p>Alexander rejoicing in a victory so memorable, which
led him to believe that the East to its utmost limits had
been opened up to his arms, sacrificed to the sun,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and
having also summoned the soldiers to a general meeting,
he praised them for their services, that they might with
the greater alacrity undertake the wars that yet remained.
He pointed out to them that all power of opposition on
the part of the Indians had been quite overthrown in the
battle just fought. What now remained for them was a
noble spoil. The much-rumoured riches of the East
abounded in those very regions, to which their steps
were now bent. The spoils accordingly which they had
taken from the Persians had now become cheap and
common. They were going to fill with pearls, precious
stones, gold, and ivory, not only their private abodes, but
all Macedonia and Greece. The soldiers who coveted
money as well as glory, and who had never known his
promises to fail, on hearing all this, readily placed their
services at his command. He sent them away full of good
hope, and ordered ships to be built in order that when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
had overrun all Asia, he might be able to visit the sea
which formed the boundary of the world.</p>

<p>In the neighbouring mountains was abundance of
timber fit for building ships, and the men in hewing
down the trees came upon serpents of most extraordinary
size.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> There they also found the rhinoceros, an animal
rarely met with elsewhere. This is not the name it bears
among the Indians, but one given it by the Greeks, who
were ignorant of the speech of the country.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The king
having built two cities, one on each side of the river
which he had lately crossed, presented each of the
generals with a crown, in addition to a thousand pieces
of gold. Others also received rewards in accordance
either with the place which they held in his friendship,
or the value of the services which they had rendered.
Abisares, who had sent envoys to Alexander before the
battle with Porus had come off, now sent others to assure
him that he was ready to do whatever he commanded,
provided only he was not obliged to surrender his
person; for he could neither live, he said, without
having the power of a king, nor have that power if he
were to be kept in captivity. Alexander bade them tell
their master that if he grudged to come to Alexander,
Alexander would go to him.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter I. Continued.—Alexander advancing farther into the
interior of India, passes through forests and deserts—Crosses
the Hydraotes—Besieges and captures Sangala,
and enters the kingdom of Sopithes, who receives him
with great hospitality and shows him a dog and lion
fight</i></h5>

<p>After crossing a river some distance farther on, he
advanced into the interior parts of India. The forests
there extended over an almost boundless tract of country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
and abounded with umbrageous trees of stateliest growth,
that rose to an extraordinary height. Numerous branches,
which for size equalled the trunk of ordinary trees, would
bend down to the earth, and then shoot straight up again
at the point where they bent upward, so that they had
more the appearance of a tree growing from its own root
than of a bough branching out from its stem.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The climate
is salubrious, for the dense shade mitigates the violence of
the heat, and copious springs supply the land with abundance
of water. But here, also, were multitudes of serpents,
the scales of which glittered like gold. The poison of
these is deadlier than any other, since their bite was wont
to prove instantly fatal, until a proper antidote was
pointed out by the natives.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> From thence they passed
through deserts to the river Hyarôtis, the banks of which
were covered with a dense forest, abounding with trees not
elsewhere seen, and filled with wild peacocks.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Decamping
hence, he came to a town that lay not far off. This
he captured by a general attack all round the walls, and
having received hostages, imposed a tribute upon the
inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> He came next to a great city—great at
least for that region—and found it not only encompassed
with a wall, but further defended by a morass.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The barbarians nevertheless sallied out to give battle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
taking their waggons with them, which they fastened
together each to each. For weapons of offence some had
pikes and others axes, and they were in the habit of
leaping nimbly from waggon to waggon if they saw their
friends hard pressed and wished to help them. This mode
of fighting being quite new to the Macedonians, at first
alarmed them,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> since they were wounded by enemies
beyond their reach, but coming afterwards to look with
contempt upon a force so undisciplined, they completely
surrounded the waggons and began stabbing all the men
that offered resistance. The king then commanded the
cords which fastened the waggons together to be cut<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> that
it might be easier for the soldiers to beset each waggon
separately. The enemy after a loss of 8000 men withdrew
into the town.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Next day the walls were escaladed all
round and captured. A few were indebted for their safety
to their swiftness of foot. Those who swam across the
sheet of water when they saw the city was sacked, carried
great consternation to the neighbouring towns, where they
reported that an invincible army, one of gods assuredly,
had arrived in the country.</p>

<p>Alexander having sent Perdiccas with a body of light
troops to ravage the country, and given another detachment
to Eumenes to be employed in bringing the barbarians
to submission, marched himself with the rest of the army
against a strong city within which the inhabitants of some
other cities had taken refuge. The citizens sent deputies
to appease the king’s anger, but continued all the same to
make warlike preparations. A dissension, it seems, had
arisen among them and divided their counsels, some preferring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
to submit to the last extremities rather than surrender,
others thinking that resistance on their part would
be altogether futile. But as no consultation was held in
common, those who were bent on surrendering threw open
the gates and admitted the enemy. Alexander would
have been justified in making the advocates of resistance
feel his displeasure, but he nevertheless pardoned them all
without exception, and after taking hostages marched
forward to the next city. As the hostages were led in
the van of the army, the defenders on the wall recognised
them to be their own countrymen, and invited them to a
conference. Here they were prevailed on to surrender,
when they were informed of the king’s clemency to the
submissive, and his severity if opposed. In a similar way
he gained over other towns, and placed them under his
protection.</p>

<p>They entered next the dominions of King Sopithes,<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
whose nation in the opinion of the barbarians excels
in wisdom, and lives under good laws and customs.
Here they do not acknowledge and rear children
according to the will of the parents, but as the officers
entrusted with the medical inspection of infants may
direct, for if they have remarked anything deformed or
defective in the limbs of a child they order it to be
killed.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> In contracting marriages they do not seek an
alliance with high birth, but make their choice by the
looks, for beauty in the children is a quality highly
appreciated.</p>

<p>Alexander had brought up his army before the capital
of this nation where Sopithes was himself resident. The
gates were shut, but as no men-at-arms showed themselves
either on the walls or towers, the Macedonians were in
doubt whether the inhabitants had deserted the city, or
were hiding themselves to fall upon the enemy by surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
The gate, however, was on a sudden thrown open, and the
Indian king with two grown-up sons issued from it to meet
Alexander. He was distinguished above all the other
barbarians by his tall and handsome figure. His royal
robe, which flowed down to his very feet, was all inwrought
with gold and purple. His sandals were of gold and
studded with precious stones, and even his arms and
wrists were curiously adorned with pearls. At his ears
he wore pendants of precious stones which from their
lustre and magnitude were of an inestimable value. His
sceptre too was made of gold and set with beryls,<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> and
this he delivered up to Alexander with an expression of
his wish that it might bring him good luck, and be accepted
as a token that he surrendered into his hands his children
and his kingdom.</p>

<p>His country possesses a noble breed of dogs, used for
hunting, and said to refrain from barking when they sight
their game which is chiefly the lion.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Sopithes wishing to
show Alexander the strength and mettle of these dogs,
caused a very large lion to be placed within an enclosure
where four dogs in all were let loose upon him. The dogs
at once fastened upon the wild beast, when one of the
huntsmen who was accustomed to work of this kind tried
to pull away by the leg one of the dogs which with the
others had seized the lion, and when the limb would not
come away, cut it off with a knife. The dog could not
even by this means be forced to let go his hold, and so
the man proceeded to cut him in another place, and finding
him still clutching the lion as tenaciously as before, he continued
cutting away with his knife one part of him after
another. The brave dog, however, even in dying kept his
fangs fixed in the lion’s flesh; so great is the eagerness for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
hunting which nature has implanted in these animals, as
testified by the accounts transmitted to us.</p>

<p>I must observe, however, that I copy from preceding
writers more than I myself believe, for I neither wish to
guarantee statements of the truth of which I am doubtful,
nor yet to suppress what I find recorded. Alexander
therefore leaving Sopithes in possession of his kingdom,
advanced to the river Hyphasis, where he was rejoined by
Hephaestion who had subdued a district situated in a
different direction. Phegeus,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> who was king of the nearest
nation, having beforehand ordered his subjects to attend
to the cultivation of their fields according to their wont,
went forth to meet Alexander with presents and assurances
that whatever he commanded he would not fail to perform.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter II.—Alexander obtains information about the
Ganges and the strength of the army kept by Agrammes,
king of the Prasians—His speech to the soldiers to
induce them to advance to the Ganges</i></h5>

<p>The king made a halt of two days with this prince,
designing on the third day to cross the river, the passage
of which was difficult, not only from its great breadth,
but also because its channel was obstructed with rocks.
Having therefore requested Phegeus to tell him what he
wanted to know, he learned the following particulars:
Beyond the river lay extensive deserts which it would
take eleven days to traverse.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Next came the Ganges,
the largest river in all India, the farther bank of which
was inhabited by two nations, the Gangaridae and the
Prasii,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> whose king Agrammes<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> kept in the field for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
guarding the approaches to his country 20,000 cavalry
and 200,000 infantry, besides 2000 four-horsed chariots,
and, what was the most formidable force of all, a troop of
elephants which he said ran up to the number of 3000.</p>

<p>All this seemed to the king to be incredible, and he
therefore asked Porus, who happened to be in attendance,
whether the account was true. He assured Alexander in
reply that, as far as the strength of the nation and
kingdom was concerned, there was no exaggeration in the
reports, but that the present king was not merely a man
originally of no distinction, but even of the very meanest
condition. His father was in fact a barber, scarcely
staving off hunger by his daily earnings, but who, from
his being not uncomely in person, had gained the affections
of the queen, and was by her influence advanced to too
near a place in the confidence of the reigning monarch.
Afterwards, however, he treacherously murdered his sovereign;
and then, under the pretence of acting as guardian
to the royal children, usurped the supreme authority,
and having put the young princes to death begot the
present king, who was detested and held cheap by his
subjects, as he rather took after his father than conducted
himself as the occupant of a throne.</p>

<p>The attestation of Porus to the truth of what he had
heard made the king anxious on manifold grounds; for
while he thought contemptuously of the men and elephants
that would oppose him, he dreaded the difficult nature of
the country that lay before him, and in particular, the
impetuous rapidity of the rivers. The task seemed
hard indeed, to follow up and unearth men removed
almost to the uttermost bounds of the world. On the
other hand, his avidity of glory and his insatiable ambition
forbade him to think that any place was so far distant or
inaccessible as to be beyond his reach. He did indeed
sometimes doubt whether the Macedonians who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
traversed all those broad lands and grown old in battlefields
and camps, would be willing to follow him through
obstructing rivers and the many other difficulties which
nature would oppose to their advance. Overflowing and
laden with booty, they would rather, he judged, enjoy
what they had won than wear themselves out in getting
more. They could not of course be of the same mind as
himself, for while he had grasped the conception of a
world-wide empire, and stood as yet but on the threshold
of his labours, they were now worn out with toil, and
longed for the time when, all their dangers being at length
ended, they might enjoy their latest winnings. In the
end ambition carried the day against reason; and, having
summoned a meeting of the soldiers, he addressed them
very much to this effect:</p>

<p>“I am not ignorant, soldiers, that during these last
days the natives of this country have been spreading all
sorts of rumours designed expressly to work upon your
fears; but the falsehood of those who invent such lies is
nothing new in your experience. The Persians in this
sort of way sought to terrify you with the gates of Cilicia,
with the plains of Mesopotamia, with the Tigris and
Euphrates, and yet this river you crossed by a ford, and
that by means of a bridge. Fame is never brought to a
clearness in which facts can be seen as they are. They
are all magnified when she transmits them. Even our
own glory, though resting on a solid basis, is more indebted
for its greatness to rumour than to reality. Who
but till the other day believed that it was possible for us
to bear the shock of those monstrous beasts that looked
like so many ramparts, or that we could have passed the
Hydaspes, or conquered other difficulties which after all
were more formidable to hear of than they proved
to be in actual experience. By my troth we had long
ago fled from Asia could fables have been able to
scare us.</p>

<p>“Can you suppose that the herds of elephants are
greater than of other cattle when the animal is known to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
be rare, hard to be caught, and harder still to tame?<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> It
is the same spirit of falsehood which magnifies the number
of horse and foot possessed by the enemy; and with respect
to the river, why, the wider it spreads the liker it becomes
to a placid pool. Rivers, as you know, that are confined
between narrow banks and choked by narrow channels
flow with torrent speed, while on the other hand the
current slackens as the channel widens out. Besides, all
the danger is at the bank where the enemy waits to
receive us as we disembark; so that, be the breadth of
the river what it may, the danger is all the same when we
are in the act of landing. But let us suppose that these
stories are all true, is it then, I ask, the monstrous size of
the elephants or the number of the enemy that you dread?
As for the elephants, we had an example of them before
our eyes in the late battle when they charged more
furiously upon their own ranks than upon ours, and when
their vast bodies were cut and mangled by our bills and
axes. What matters it then whether they be the same
number as Porus had, or be 3000, when we see that if
one or two of them be wounded, the rest swerve aside
and take to flight. Then again, if it be no easy task
to manage but a few of them, surely when so many
thousands of them are crowded together, they cannot
but hamper each other when their huge unwieldy bodies
want room either to stand or run. For myself, I have
such a poor opinion of the animals that, though I had
them, I did not bring them into the field, being fully convinced
they occasion more danger to their own side than
to the enemy.</p>

<p>“But it is the number, perhaps, of the horse and
foot that excites your fears! for you have been wont, you
know, to fight only against small numbers, and will now
for the first time have to withstand undisciplined multitudes!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
The river Granicus is a witness of the courage of
the Macedonians unconquered in fighting against odds;<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
so too is Cilicia deluged with the blood of the Persians,
and Arbela, where the plains are strewn with the bones of
your vanquished foes. It is too late, now that you have
depopulated Asia by your victories, to begin counting the
enemy’s legions. When we were crossing the Hellespont,
it was then we should have thought about the smallness of
our numbers, for now Scythians follow us, Bactrian troops
are here to assist us, Dahans and Sogdians are serving in
our ranks. But it is not in such a throng I put my trust.
It is to your hands, Macedonians, I look. It is your
valour I take as the gage and surety of the deeds I mean
to perform.</p>

<p>“As long as it is with you I shall stand in battle, I
count not the number either of my own or the enemy’s
army. Do ye only, I entreat, keep your minds full of
alacrity and confidence. We are not standing on the
threshold of our enterprise and our labours, but at their
very close. We have already reached the sunrise and
the ocean, and unless your sloth and cowardice prevent,
we shall thence return in triumph to our native land,
having conquered the earth to its remotest bounds. Act
not then like foolish husbandmen who, when their crops
are ripe, loose them out of hand from sheer indolence to
gather them. The prizes before you are greater than the
risks, for the country to be invaded not only teems with
wealth, but is at the same time feebly defended. So
then I lead you not so much to glory as to plunder.
You have earned the right to carry back to your own
country the riches which that sea casts upon its shores;
and it would ill become you if through fear you should
leave anything unattempted or unperformed. I conjure
you then by that glory of yours whereby ye soar above
the topmost pinnacle of human greatness—I beseech you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
by my services unto you, and yours unto me (a strife in
which we still contend unconquered), that ye desert not
your foster-son, your fellow-soldier, not to say your king,
just at the moment when he is approaching the limits of
the inhabited world.</p>

<p>“All things else you have done at my orders—for this
one thing I shall hold myself to be your debtor. I, who
never ordered you upon any service in which I did not
place myself in the fore-front of the danger, I who have
often with mine own buckler covered you in battle, now
entreat you not to shatter the palm which is already
in my grasp, and by which, if I may so speak without
incurring the ill-will of heaven, I shall become the equal
of Hercules and Father Bacchus. Grant this to my
entreaties, and break at last your obstinate silence.
Where is that familiar shout, the wonted token of your
alacrity? Where are the cheerful looks of my Macedonians?
I do not recognise you, soldiers, and, methinks,
I seem not to be recognised by you. I have all along
been knocking at deaf ears. I am trying to rouse hearts
that are disloyal and crushed with craven fears.”</p>

<p>When the soldiers, with their heads bent earthwards,
still suppressed what they felt, “I must,” he said, “have
inadvertently given you some offence that you will not
even look at me. Methinks I am in a solitude. No one
answers me; no one so much as says me nay. Is it
to strangers I am speaking? Am I claiming anything
unreasonable? Why, it is your glory and your greatness
we are asserting. Where are those whom but the other
day I saw eagerly striving which should have the prerogative
of receiving the person of their wounded king?
I am deserted, forsaken, surrendered into the hands of the
enemy. But I shall still persist in going forward, even
though I should march alone. Expose me then to the
dangers of rivers, to the rage of elephants, and to those
nations whose very names fill you with terror. I shall
find men that will follow me though I be deserted by
you. The Scythians and Bactrians, once our foemen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
but now our soldiers—these will still be with me.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Let
me tell you, I had die rather than be a commander on
sufferance. Begone then to your homes, and go triumphing
because ye have forsaken your king!<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> For my part,
I shall here find a place, either for the victory of which
you despair, or for an honourable death.”</p>

<h5><i>Chapter III.—Speech of Coenus on behalf of the army—Alexander’s
displeasure at the refusal of the soldiers
to advance—He resolves to return—Raises altars as
memorials of his presence—Reaches the Acesines,
where Coenus dies—Reconciles Taxiles and Porus, and
then sails down stream</i></h5>

<p>But not even by this appeal could a single word be
elicited from any of the soldiers. They waited for the
generals and chief captains to report to the king that the
men, exhausted with their wounds and incessant labours
in the field, did not refuse the duties of war, but were
simply unable to discharge them. The officers, however,
paralysed with terror, kept their eyes steadfastly fixed on
the ground, and remained silent. Then there arose, no
one knew how, first a sighing and then a sobbing, until,
little by little, their grief began to vent itself more freely
in streaming tears, so that even the king, whose anger
had been turned into pity, could not himself refrain from
tears, anxious though he was to suppress them. At last,
when the whole assembly had abandoned itself to an
unrestrained passion of weeping, Coenus, on finding that
the others were reluctant to open their lips, made bold to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
step forward to the tribunal where the king stood, and
signified that he had somewhat to say. When the soldiers
saw him removing his helmet from his head—a custom
observed in addressing the king—they earnestly besought
him that he would plead the cause of the army.</p>

<p>“May the gods,” he then said, “defend us from all
disloyal thoughts; and assuredly they do thus defend us.
Your soldiers are now of the same mind towards you as
they ever were in times past, being ready to go wherever
you order them, ready to fight your battles, to risk their
lives, and to give your name in keeping to after ages.
So then, if you still persist in your purpose, all unarmed,
naked and bloodless though we be, we either follow you,
or go on before you, according to your pleasure. But if
you desire to hear the complaints of your soldiers, which
are not feigned, but wrung from them by the sorest
necessity, vouchsafe, I entreat you, a favourable hearing
to men who have most devotedly followed your authority
and your fortunes, and are ready to follow you wherever
you may go. Oh, sir! you have conquered, by the greatness
of your deeds, not your enemies alone, but your own
soldiers as well.</p>

<p>“We again have done and suffered up to the full
measure of the capacity of mortal nature. We have
traversed seas and lands, and know them better than do
the inhabitants themselves. We are standing now almost
on the earth’s utmost verge, and yet you are preparing to
go to a sphere altogether new—to go in quest of an
India unknown even to the Indians themselves. You
would fain root out from their hidden recesses and dens
a race of men that herd with snakes and wild beasts, so
that you may traverse as a conqueror more regions than
the sun surveys. The thought is altogether worthy of a
soul so lofty as thine, but it is above ours; for while thy
courage will be ever growing, our vigour is fast waning to
its end.</p>

<p>“See how bloodless be our bodies, pierced with how
many wounds, and gashed with how many scars! Our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
weapons are now blunt, our armour quite worn out. We
have been driven to assume the Persian garb since that
of our own country cannot be brought up to supply us.
We have degenerated so far as to adopt a foreign costume.
Among how many of us is there to be found a single coat
of mail? Which of us has a horse? Cause it to be
inquired how many have servants to follow them, how
much of his booty each one has now left. We have
conquered all the world, but are ourselves destitute of all
things. Can you think of exposing such a noble army
as this, all naked and defenceless, to the mercy of savage
beasts, whose numbers, though purposely exaggerated by
the barbarians, must yet, as I can gather from the lying
report itself, be very considerable. If, however, you are
bent on penetrating still farther into India, that part of it
which lies towards the south is not so vast, and were this
subdued you could then quickly find your way to that
sea which nature has ordained to be the boundary of the
inhabited world. Why do you make a long circuit in
pursuit of glory when it is placed immediately within
your reach, for even here the ocean is to be found.
Unless, then, you wish to go wandering about, we have
already reached the goal unto which your fortune leads
you. I have preferred to speak on these matters in your
presence, O King! rather than to discuss them with the
soldiers in your absence, not that I have in view to gain
thereby for myself the good graces of the army here
assembled, but that you might learn their sentiments from
my lips rather than be obliged to hear their murmurs and
their groans.”<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>When Coenus had made an end of speaking there
arose from all parts of the audience assenting shouts,
mingled with lamentations and confused voices, calling
Alexander king, father, lord, and master. And now also
the other officers, especially the seniors, who from their
age possessed all the greater authority, and could with a
better grace beg to be excused from any more service,
united in making the same request. Alexander therefore
found himself unable either to rebuke them for their stubbornness
or to appease their angry mood. Being thus
quite at a loss what to do, he leaped down from the
tribunal and shut himself up in the royal pavilion, into
which he forbade any one to be admitted except his
ordinary attendants. For two days he indulged his anger,
but on the third day he emerged from his seclusion, and
ordered twelve altars of square stone to be erected as a
monument of his expedition. He ordered also the fortifications
around the camp to be drawn out wide, and
couches of a larger size than was required for men of
ordinary stature to be left, so that by making things
appear in magnificent proportions he might astonish
posterity by deceptive wonders.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>From this place he marched back the way he had
come, and encamped near the river Acesines. There
Coenus caught an illness, which carried him off.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> The
king was doubtless deeply grieved by his death, but yet
he could not forbear remarking that it was but for the
sake of a few days he had opened a long-winded speech
as though he alone were destined to see Macedonia again.
The fleet which he had ordered to be built was now riding
in the stream ready for service. Memnon also had
meanwhile brought from Thrace a reinforcement of 5000
cavalry, together with 7000 infantry sent by Harpalus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
He also brought 25,000 suits of armour inlaid with silver
and gold, and these Alexander distributed to the troops,
commanding the old suits to be burned.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Designing now
to make for the ocean with a thousand ships, he left Porus
and Taxiles, the Indian kings who had been disagreeing
and raking up old feuds, in friendly relations with each
other, strengthened by a marriage alliance; and as they
had done their utmost to help him forward with the building
of his fleet, he confirmed each in his sovereignty. He
built also two towns, one of which he called Nicaea, and
the other Bucephala, dedicating the latter to the memory
of the horse which he had lost. Then leaving orders for
the elephants and baggage to follow him by land, he
sailed down the river, proceeding every day about 40
stadia, to allow the troops to land from time to time where
they could conveniently be put ashore.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter IV.—Alexander subdues various tribes on his way
to the Indus—Disasters to his fleet at the meeting of
the rivers—His campaign against the Sudracae and
Malli—Assails their chief stronghold and is left
standing alone on the wall</i></h5>

<p>Thus he came at length into the country where the
river Hydaspes falls into the Acesines, and thence flows
down to the territories of the Sibi.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> These people allege
that their ancestors belonged to the army of Hercules,
and that being left behind on account of sickness had
possessed themselves of the seats which their posterity
now occupied. They dressed themselves with the skins
of wild beasts, and had clubs for their weapons. They
showed besides many other traces of their origin, though
in the course of time Greek manners and institutions had
grown obsolete. He landed among them, and marching
a distance of 250 stadia into the country beyond their
borders, laid it waste, and took its capital town by an
assault made against the walls all round. The nation,
consisting of 40,000 foot-soldiers, had been drawn up
along the bank of the river to oppose his landing, but he
nevertheless crossed the stream, put the enemy to flight,
and, having stormed the town, compelled all who were
shut up within its walls to surrender. Those who were
of military age were put to the sword, and the rest were
sold as slaves.</p>

<p>He then laid siege to another town, but the defenders
made so gallant a resistance that he was repulsed with
the loss of many of his Macedonians.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> He persevered,
however, with the siege till the inhabitants, despairing of
their safety, set fire to their houses, and cast themselves
along with their wives and children into the flames.
War then showed itself in a new form, for while the
inhabitants were destroying their city by spreading the
flames, the enemy were striving to save it by quenching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
them, so completely does war invert natural relations.
The citadel of the town had escaped damage, and Alexander
accordingly left a garrison behind in it. He was
himself conveyed by means of boats around the fortress,
for the three largest rivers in India (if we except the
Ganges) washed the line of its fortifications. The Indus
on the north flows close up to it, and on the south the
Acesines unites with the Hydaspes.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>But the meeting of the rivers makes the waters swell
in great billows like those of the ocean, and the navigable
way is compressed into a narrow channel by extensive
mud-banks kept continually shifting by the force of the
confluent waters. When the waves, therefore, in thick
succession dashed against the vessels, beating both on
their prows and sides, the sailors were obliged to take in
sail; but partly from their own flurry, and partly from
the force of the currents, they were unable to execute
their orders in time, and before the eyes of all two of the
large ships were engulphed in the stream. The smaller
craft, however, though they also were unmanageable,
were driven on shore without sustaining injury. The
ship which had the king himself on board was caught in
eddies of the greatest violence, and by their force was
irresistibly driven athwart and whirled onward without
answering the helm.</p>

<p>He had already stripped off his clothes preparatory to
throwing himself into the river, while his friends were
swimming about not far off ready to pick him up, but as
it was evident that the danger was about equal whether
he threw himself into the water or remained on board,
the boatmen vied with each other in stretching to their
oars, and made every exertion possible for human beings
to force their vessel through the raging surges. It then
seemed as though the waves were being cloven asunder,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
and as though the whirling eddies were retreating, and the
ship was thus at length rescued from their grasp. It did
not, however, gain the shore in safety, but was stranded on
the nearest shallows. One would suppose that a war
had been waged against the river. Alexander there
erected as many altars as there were rivers, and having
offered sacrifices upon them marched onward, accomplishing
a distance of thirty stadia.</p>

<p>Thence he came into the dominions of the Sudracae
and the Malli, who hitherto had usually been at war with
each other, but now drew together in presence of the
common danger. Their army consisted of 90,000 foot-soldiers,
all fit for active service, together with 10,000
cavalry and 900 war chariots. But when the Macedonians,
who believed that they had by this time got
past all their dangers, found that they had still on hand
a fresh war, in which the most warlike nations in all
India would be their antagonists, they were struck with
an unexpected terror, and began again to upbraid the
king in the language of sedition. “Though he had been
driven,” they said, “to give up the river Ganges and
regions beyond it, he had not ended the war, but only
shifted it. They were now exposed to fierce nations
that with their blood they might open for him a way to
the ocean. They were dragged onward outside the range
of the constellations and the sun of their own zone, and
forced to go to places which nature meant to be hidden
from mortal eyes.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> New enemies were for ever springing
up with arms ever new, and though they put them
all to rout and flight, what reward awaited them? What
but mists and darkness and unbroken night hovering
over the abyss of ocean? What but a sea teeming with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
multitudes of frightful monsters—stagnating waters in
which expiring nature has given way in despair?”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The king, troubled not by any fears for himself, but
by the anxiety of the soldiers about their safety, called
them together, and pointed out to them that those of
whom they were afraid were weak and unwarlike; that
after the conquest of these tribes there was nothing in
their way, once they had traversed the distance now
between them and the ocean, to prevent their coming to
the end of the world, which would be also the end of
their labours; that he had given way to their fears of
the Ganges and of the numerous tribes beyond that
river, and turned his arms to a quarter where the glory
would be equal but the hazard less; that they were
already in sight of the ocean, and were already fanned
by breezes from the sea.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> They should not then grudge
him the glory to which he aspired. They would overpass
the limits reached by Hercules and Father Bacchus,
and thus at a small cost bestow upon their king an
immortality of fame. They should permit him to return
from India with honour, and not to escape from it like a
fugitive.</p>

<p>Every assemblage, and especially one of soldiers, is
readily carried away by any chance impulse, and hence
the measures for quelling a mutiny are less important
than the circumstances in which it originates. Never
before did so eager and joyous a shout ring out as was
now sent forth by the army asking him to lead them
forward, and expressing the hope that the gods would
prosper his arms and make him equal in glory to those
whom he was emulating. Alexander, elated by these
acclamations, at once broke up his camp and advanced
against the enemy, which was the strongest in point of
numbers of all the Indian tribes. They were making
active preparations for war, and had selected as their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
head a brave warrior of the nation of the Sudracae.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
This experienced general had encamped at the foot of a
mountain, and had ordered fires to be kindled over a
wide circuit to make his army appear so much the more
numerous. He endeavoured also at times, but in vain,
to alarm the Macedonians when at rest by making his
men shout and howl in their own barbarous manner.</p>

<p>As soon as day dawned, the king, full of hope and
confidence, ordered his soldiers, who were eager for action,
to take their arms and march to battle. The barbarians,
however, fled all of a sudden, but whether through fear
or dissensions that had arisen among them, there is no
record to show. At any rate, they escaped timeously to
their mountain recesses, which were difficult of approach.
The king pursued the fugitives, but to no purpose; however,
he took their baggage.</p>

<p>Thence he came into the city of the Sudracae, into
which most of the enemy had fled,<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> trusting for safety as
much to their arms as to the strength of the fortifications.
The king was now advancing to attack the place, when
a soothsayer warned him not to undertake the siege, or
at all events to postpone it, since the omens indicated
that his life would be in danger. The king fixing his
eyes upon Demophon (for this was the name of the
soothsayer), said: “If any one should in this manner
interrupt thyself, while busied with thine art and inspecting
entrails, wouldst thou not regard him as impertinent
and troublesome?” “I certainly would so regard him,”
said Demophon. Then rejoined Alexander, “Dost thou
not think then that when I am occupied with such important
matters, and not with the inspection of the entrails of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
cattle, there can be any interruption more unseasonable
to me than a soothsayer enslaved by superstition?”<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
Without more loss of time than was required for returning
the answer, he ordered the scaling-ladders to be
applied to the wall, and while the others were hesitating
to mount them, he himself scaled the ramparts.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The parapet which ran round the rampart was narrow,
and was not marked out along the coping with battlements
and embrasures, but was built in an unbroken line
of breastwork, which obstructed assailants in attempting
to get over. The king then was clinging to the edge of
the parapet, rather than standing upon it, warding off
with his shield the darts that fell upon him from every
side, for he was assailed by missiles from all the surrounding
towers. Nor were the soldiers able to mount the
wall under the storm of arrows discharged against them
from above.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Still at last a sense of shame overcame their
fear of the greatness of the danger, for they saw that by
their hesitation the king would fall into the hands of
his enemies. But their help was delayed by their hurry,
for while every one strove to get soonest to the top of the
wall, they were precipitated from the ladders which they
overloaded till they broke, thus balking the king of his
only hope. He was in consequence left standing in sight
of his numerous army, like a man in a solitude, whom all
the world has forsaken.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter V.—Alexander is severely wounded by an arrow
within the stronghold of the Sudracae—The arrow is
extracted by Critobulus</i></h5>

<p>By this time his left hand, with which he was shifting
his buckler about, became tired with parrying the blows
directed against him from all round, and his friends cried
out to him that he should leap down, and were standing
ready to catch him when he fell. But instead of taking
this course, he did an act of daring past all belief and
unheard of—an act notable as adding far more to his
reputation for rashness than to his true glory. For with
a headlong spring he flung himself into the city filled
with his enemies, even though he could scarcely expect to
die fighting, since before he could rise from the ground
he was likely to be overpowered and taken prisoner.
But, as luck would have it, he had flung his body with
such nice poise that he alighted on his feet, which gave
him the advantage of an erect attitude when he began
fighting. Fortune had also so provided that he could
not possibly be surrounded, for an aged tree which grew
not far from the wall, had thrown out branches thickly
covered with leaves, as if for the very purpose of sheltering
the king. Against the huge bole of this tree he so
planted himself that he could not be surrounded, and as
he was thus protected in rear, he received on his buckler
the darts with which he was assailed in front; for single-handed
though he was, not one of the many who set
upon him ventured to come to close-quarters with him,
and their missiles lodged more frequently in the branches
of the tree than in his buckler.</p>

<p>What served him well at this juncture was the far-spread
renown of his name, and next to that despair,
which above everything nerves men to die gloriously.
But as the numbers of the enemy were constantly
increasing, his buckler was by this time loaded with
darts, and his helmet shattered by stones, while his knees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
sank under him from the fatigue of his protracted
exertions. On seeing this, they who stood nearest
incautiously rushed upon him in contempt of the danger.
Two of these he smote with his sword, and laid them
dead at his feet, and after that no one could muster up
courage enough to go near him. They only plied him
with darts and arrows from a distance off.</p>

<p>But though thus exposed as a mark for every shot, he
had no great difficulty in protecting himself while crouching
on his knees, until an Indian let fly an arrow two
cubits long (for the Indians, as remarked already, use
arrows of this length), and pierced him through his
armour a little above his right side. Struck down by
this wound, from which the blood spirted in great jets,
he let his weapon drop as if he were dying without
strength enough left to let his right hand extract the
arrow. The archer, accordingly, who had wounded him,
exulting in his success, ran forward with eager haste to
strip his body. But Alexander no sooner felt him lay
hands on his person, than he became so exasperated by
the supreme indignity, I imagine, of the outrage, that he
recalled his swooning spirit, and with an upward thrust
of his sword pierced the exposed side of his antagonist.
Thus there lay dead around the king three of his assailants,
while the others stood off like men stupefied.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he endeavoured to raise himself up with
his buckler, that he might die sword in hand, before his
last breath left him, but finding he had not strength
enough for the effort, he grasped with his right hand some
of the defending boughs, and tried to rise with their help.
His strength was, however, inadequate even to support
his body, and he fell down again upon his knees, waving
his hand as a challenge to the enemy to meet him in close
combat if any of them dared. At length Peucestas in a
different quarter of the town beat off the men who were
defending the wall, and following the king’s traces came
to where he was. Alexander on seeing him thought that
he had come not to succour him in life, but to comfort him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
in his death, and giving way through sheer exhaustion,
fell over on his shield.</p>

<p>Then came up Timaeus, and a little afterwards
Leonnatus followed by Aristonus.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The Indians, on
discovering that the king was within their walls, abandoned
all other places and ran in crowds to where he was, and
pressed hard upon those who defended him. Timaeus,
one of such, after receiving many wounds and making a
gallant struggle, fell. Peucestas again, though pierced
with three javelin wounds, held up his buckler not for
his own, but the king’s protection. Leonnatus, while
endeavouring to drive back the barbarians who were
eagerly pressing forward, was severely wounded in the
neck, and fell down in a swoon at the king’s feet.
Peucestas was also now quite exhausted with the loss of
blood from his wounds and could no longer hold up his
buckler. Thus all the hope now lay in Aristonus, but he
also was desperately wounded, and could no longer sustain
the onset of so many assailants. In the meantime the
rumour that the king had fallen reached the Macedonians.</p>

<p>What would have terrified others only served to
stimulate their ardour, for, heedless of every danger, they
broke down the wall with their pickaxes, and where they
had made an entrance burst into the city and massacred
great numbers of the Indians, chiefly in the pursuit, no
resistance being offered except by a mere handful. They
spared neither old men, women, nor children, but held
whomsoever they met to have been the person by whom
the king had been wounded, and in this way they at
length satiated their righteous indignation.</p>

<p>Clitarchus and Timagenes state that Ptolemy, who
afterwards became a king, was present at this fighting, but
Ptolemy himself, who would not of course gainsay his
own glory, has recorded in his memoirs that he was away
at the time, as the king had sent him on an expedition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
elsewhere. This instance shows how great was the
carelessness of the authors who composed these old books
of history, or, it may be, their credulity, which is just as
great a dereliction of their duty. The king was carried
into a tent, where the surgeons cut off the wooden shaft of
the arrow which had pierced him, taking care not to stir
its point. When his armour was taken off they discovered
that the weapon was barbed, and that it could not be
extracted without danger except by making an incision to
open the wound. But here again they were afraid lest in
operating they should be unable to staunch the flow of
blood, for the weapon was large and had been driven
home with such force that it had evidently pierced to the
inwards.</p>

<p>Critobulus, who was famous for his surgical skill,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> was
nevertheless swayed by fear in a case so precarious, and
dreaded to put his hand to the work lest his failure to
effect a cure should recoil on his own head. The king
observing him to weep, and to be showing signs of fear, and
looking ghastly pale, said to him: “For what and how
long are you waiting that you do not set to work as quickly
as possible? If die I must, free me at least from the pain
I suffer. Are you afraid lest you should be held to account
because I have received an incurable wound?” Then Critobulus,
at last overcoming, or perhaps dissembling his fear,
begged Alexander to suffer himself to be held while he
was extracting the point, since even a slight motion of his
body would be of dangerous consequence. To this the
king replied that there was no need of men to hold him,
and then, agreeably to what had been enjoined him, he
did not wince the least during the operation.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>When the wound had then been laid wide open and
the point extracted, there followed such a copious discharge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
of blood that the king began to swoon, while a dark mist
came over his eyes, and he lay extended as if he were
dying. Every remedy was applied to staunch the blood,
but all to no purpose, so that the king’s friends, believing
him to be dead, broke out into cries and lamentations.
The bleeding did, however, at last stop, and the patient
gradually recovered consciousness and began to recognise
those who stood around him. All that day and the night
which followed the army lay under arms around the royal
tent. All of them confessed that their life depended on
his single breath, and they could not be prevailed on to
withdraw until they had ascertained that he had fallen
into a quiet sleep. Thereupon they returned to the camp
entertaining more assured hopes of his recovery.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter VI.—Alexander recovers and shows himself to the
army—His officers remonstrate with him for his
recklessness in exposing his life to danger—His reply
to their appeal</i></h5>

<p>The king, who had now been kept for the space of
seven days under treatment for his wound without its
being as yet cicatrised, on hearing that a report of his
death had gained a wide currency among the barbarians,
caused two ships to be lashed together and his tent to be
set up in the centre where it would be conspicuous to
every one, so that he might therefrom show himself to
those who believed him to be dead. By thus exposing
himself to the view of the inhabitants he crushed the hope
with which the false report had inspired his enemies. He
then sailed down the river,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> starting a good while before
the rest of the fleet, lest the repose which his weak bodily
condition still required should be disturbed by the noise
of rowing. On the fourth day after he had embarked he
reached a country deserted by its inhabitants, but fruitful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
in corn and well stocked with cattle. Here along with
his soldiers he enjoyed a welcome season of rest.</p>

<p>Now it was a custom among the Macedonians that the
king’s especial friends and those who had the guard of his
person watched before his tent during any occasional
illness. This custom being now observed as usual,
they all entered his chamber in a body. Alexander
fearing they might be the bearers of some bad news, since
they had all come together, enquired whether they had
come to inform him that the enemy had that moment
arrived. Then Craterus, who had been chosen by the
others as their medium to let the king know the entreaties
of his friends, addressed him in these terms: “Can you
imagine,” he began, “that we could be more alarmed by
the enemy’s approach, even if they were already within our
lines, than we are concerned for your personal safety, by
which, it seems, you set but little store? Were the
united powers of the whole world to conspire against us,
were they to cover the land all over with arms and men,
to cover the seas with fleets, and lead ferocious wild
beasts against us, we shall prove invincible to every foe
when we have you to lead us. But which of the gods
can ensure that this the stay and star of Macedonia will
be long preserved to us when you are so forward to
expose your person to manifest dangers, forgetting that
you draw into peril the lives of so many of your countrymen?
For which of us wishes to survive you, or even has
it within his power? Under your conduct and command
we have advanced so far that there is no one but yourself
who can lead us back to our hearths and homes.</p>

<p>“No doubt while you were still contending with
Darius for the sovereignty of Persia, one could not even
think it strange (though no one wished it) that you were
ever ready and eager to rush boldly into danger, for
where the risk and the reward are fairly balanced, the
gain is not only more ample in case of success, but the
solace is greater in case of defeat. But that your very
life should be paid as the price of an obscure village,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
which of your soldiers, nay, what inhabitant of any
barbarous country that has heard of your greatness can
tolerate such an idea? My soul is struck with horror
when I think of the scene which was lately presented to
our eyes.</p>

<p>“I cannot but tremble to relate that the hands of the
greatest dastards would have polluted the spoils stripped
from the invincible Alexander, had not fortune, looking
with pity on us, interfered for your deliverance. We are
no better than traitors, no better than deserters, all of us
who were unable to keep up with you when you ran into
danger; and should you therefore brand us all with
dishonour, none of us will refuse to give satisfaction for
that from the guilt of which he could not secure himself.
Show us, we beseech you then, in some other
way, how cheap you hold us. We are ready to go
wherever you order. We solicit that for us you reserve
obscure dangers and inglorious battles, while you save
yourself for those occasions which give scope for your
greatness. Glory won in a contest with inferior opponents
soon becomes stale, and nothing can be more absurd than
to let your valour be wasted where it cannot be displayed
to view.”</p>

<p>Ptolemy and others who were present addressed him
in the same or similar terms, and all of them, as one man,
besought him with tears that, sated as he was with glory,
he would at last set some limits to that passion and
have more regard for his own safety, on which that of the
public depended. The affection and loyalty of his friends
were so gratifying to the king that he embraced them one
by one with more than his usual warmth, and requested
them all to be seated.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Then, in addressing them, he went far back in a review
of his career and said: “I return you, most faithful and
most dutiful subjects and friends, my most heartfelt thanks,
not only because you at this time prefer my safety to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
your own, but also because from the very outset of the
war you have lost no opportunity of showing by every
pledge and token your kindly feelings towards myself, so
that I must confess my life has never been so dear to me
as it is at present, and chiefly so, that I may long enjoy
your companionship. At the same time, I must point
out that those who are willing to lay down their lives for
me do not look at the matter from my point of view,
inasmuch as I judge myself to have deserved by my
bravery your favourable inclinations towards me, for you
may possibly be coveting to reap the fruit of my favour
for a great length of time, perhaps even in perpetuity, but
I measure myself not by the span of age, but by that of
glory.</p>

<p>“Had I been contented with my paternal heritage,
I might have spent my days within the bounds of
Macedonia, in slothful ease, to an obscure and inglorious
old age; although even those who remain indolently at
home are not masters of their own destiny, for while they
consider a long life to be the supreme good, an untimely
death often takes them by surprise. I, however, who do
not count my years but by my victories, have already had
a long career of life, if I reckon aright the gifts of fortune.
Having begun to reign in Macedonia, I now hold the
supremacy of Greece. I have subdued Thrace and the
people of Illyria; I give laws to the Triballi and the
Maedi,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> and am master of Asia from the shores of Hellespont
as far south as the shores of the Indian Ocean.
And now I am not far from the very ends of the earth,
which when I have passed I purpose to open up to
myself a new realm of nature—a new world. In the
turning-point of a single hour I crossed over from Asia
into the borders of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Having conquered both
these continents in the ninth year of my reign, and in my
twenty-eighth year, do you think I can pause in the task<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
of completing my glory, to which, and to which only, I
have entirely devoted myself? No, I shall not fail in my
duty to her, and wheresoever I shall be fighting I shall
imagine myself on the world’s theatre, with all mankind
for spectators. I shall give celebrity to places before
unnoted. I shall open up for all nations a way to regions
which nature has hitherto kept far distant.</p>

<p>“If fortune shall so direct that in the midst of these
enterprises my life be cut short, that would only add to
my renown. I am sprung from such a stock that I am
bound to prefer living much to living long.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Reflect, I
pray you, that we have come to lands in the eyes of
which the name of a woman is the most famed for valour.
What cities did Semiramis build! What nations did she
bring to subjection! What mighty works did she plan!
We have not yet equalled the glorious achievements of a
woman, and have we already had our fill of glory? No,
I say. Let the gods, however, but favour us, and things
still greater remain for us yet to do. But the countries
we have not yet reached shall only become ours on condition
that we consider nothing little in which there is room
for great glory to be won. Do you but defend me
against domestic treason and the plots of my own household,<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
and I will fearlessly face the dangers of battle and
war.</p>

<p>“Philip was safer in the field of fight than in the
theatre. He often escaped the hands of his enemies—he
could not elude those of his subjects.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> And if you
examine how other kings also came by their end, you can
count more that were slain by their own people than by
their enemies. But now lastly, since an opportunity has
presented itself to me of disclosing a matter which I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
for a long time been turning over and over in my mind, I
give you to understand that to me the greatest rewards of
all my toils and achievements will be this, that my mother
Olympias shall be deified as soon as she departs this life.
If I be spared, I shall myself discharge that duty, but if
death anticipate me, bear in memory that I have entrusted
this office to you.” With these words he dismissed his
friends; but for a good many days he remained in the
same encampment.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter VII.—The affair of Biton and Boxus at Baktra—Embassy
from the Sudracae and Malli proffering submission—Alexander
entertains his army and the embassy at a sumptuous banquet—Single combat
between a Macedonian and an Athenian champion</i></h5>

<p>While these things were doing in India, the Greek
soldiers who had been recently drafted by the king into
settlements around Bactra disagreed among themselves
and revolted, for the stronger faction, having killed some
of their countrymen who remained loyal, had recourse to
arms, and making themselves masters of the citadel of
Bactra, which happened to be carelessly guarded, forced
even the barbarians to join their party. Their leader was
Athenodorus, who had also assumed the title of king, not
so much from an ambition to reign as from a wish to
return to his native country along with those who acknowledged
his authority. Against his life one Biton, a citizen
of the same Greek state as himself, but who hated him
from envy, laid a plot, and having invited him to a
banquet, had him assassinated during the festivities by
the hands of a native of Margiana called Boxus. The
day following Biton, in a general meeting which had been
convoked, persuaded the majority that Athenodorus had
without any provocation formed a plot to take away his
life. Others, however, suspected there had been foul play
on Biton’s part, and by degrees this suspicion spread itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
about among the rest. The Greek soldiers, therefore,
took up arms to put Biton to death should an opportunity
present itself.</p>

<p>But the leading men appeased the anger of the multitude,
and Biton being thus freed from his imminent
danger, contrary to what he had anticipated, soon afterwards
conspired against the very man to whom he owed
his safety. But when his treachery came to their knowledge
they seized both Biton himself and Boxus. The latter
they ordered to be at once put to death, but Biton not till
after he had undergone torture. The instruments for this
purpose were already being applied to his limbs when the
soldiers, it is not known why, ran to their arms like so
many madmen. On hearing the uproar they made, the
men who had orders to torture Biton desisted from their
office, thinking that the object of the rioters, whom they
had heard shouting, was to prevent them going on with
their work. Biton, stripped as he was, ran for protection
to the Greeks, and the sight of the wretched man sentenced
to death caused such a revulsion of their feelings
that they ordered him to be set at liberty. Having twice
escaped punishment, he returned to his native country
with the rest of those who left the colonies which the king
had assigned to them.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> These things were done about
Bactra and the borders of Scythia.</p>

<p>In the meantime a hundred ambassadors came to the
king from the two nations we have before mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
They all rode in chariots and were men of uncommon
stature and of a very dignified bearing. Their robes
were of linen and embroidered with inwrought gold and
purple. They informed him that they surrendered into
his hands themselves, their cities, and their territories,
and that he was the first to whose authority and protection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
they had intrusted their liberty which for so many ages
they had preserved inviolate. The gods, they said, were
the authors of their submission and not fear, seeing that
they had submitted to his yoke while their strength was
quite unbroken. The king at a meeting of his council
accepted their proffer of submission and allegiance, and
imposed on them the tribute which the two nations paid
in instalments to the Arachosians.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> He further ordered
them to furnish him with 2500 horsemen, all which commands
were faithfully carried out by the barbarians.
After this he gave orders for the preparation of a splendid
banquet to which he invited the ambassadors and the petty
kings of the neighbouring tribes. Here a hundred couches
of gold had been placed at a small distance from each other,
and these were hung round with tapestry curtains which
glittered with gold and purple. In a word he displayed
at this entertainment all that was corrupt in the ancient
luxury of the Persians as well as in the new-fangled fashions
which had been adopted by the Macedonians, thus intermixing
the vices of both nations.</p>

<p>At this banquet there was present Dioxippus the
Athenian, a famous boxer,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> who on account of his surprising
strength was already well known to the king, and one even
of his favourites. Some there were who from envy and
malice used to carp at him between jest and earnest,
remarking they had a full-fed good-for-nothing beast in
their company, who when others went forth to fight would
rub himself with oil and take exercise to get up his
appetite. Now at the banquet a Macedonian called
Horratus, who was by this time “flown with wine,” began
to taunt him in the usual style, and challenged him, if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
were a man, to fight him next day with his sword, after
which the king would judge of his temerity or of the
cowardice of Dioxippus. The terms of the challenge
were accepted by Dioxippus, who treated with contempt
the bravado of the insolent soldier. The king finding
next day that the two men were more than ever bent on
fighting, and that he could not dissuade them, allowed
them to do as they pleased. The soldiers came in crowds
to witness the affair, and among others Greeks who backed
up Dioxippus.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>The Macedonian came with the proper arms, carrying
in his left hand a brazen shield and the long spear called
the <i>sarissa</i>, and in his right a javelin. He wore also a
sword by his side as if he meant to fight with several
opponents at once. Dioxippus again entered the ring
shining with oil, wearing a garland about his brows,
having a scarlet cloak wrapped about his left arm, and
carrying in his right hand a stout knotty club. This
singular mode of equipment kept all the spectators for a
time in suspense, because it seemed not temerity but
downright madness for a naked man to engage with one
armed to the teeth. The Macedonian accordingly, not
doubting for a moment but that he could kill his adversary
from a distance, cast his javelin at him, but this Dioxippus
avoided by a slight bending of his body, and before the
other could shift the long pike to his right hand, sprang
upon him and broke the weapon in two by a stroke of
his club. The Macedonian, having thus lost two of his
weapons, prepared to draw his sword, but Dioxippus closed
with him before he was ready to wield it, and suddenly
tripping up his heels, knocked him down as with a blow
from a battering-ram. He then wrested his sword from
his grasp, planted his foot on his neck as he lay prostrate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
and brandishing his club would have brained him with it,
had he not been prevented by the king.</p>

<p>The result of the match was mortifying not only to the
Macedonians, but even to Alexander himself, for he saw
with vexation that the vaunted bravery of the Macedonians
had fallen into contempt with the barbarians who
attended the spectacle. This made the king lend his ear
all too readily to the accusations of those who owed
Dioxippus a grudge. So at a feast which he attended a few
days afterwards a golden bowl was by a private arrangement
secretly taken off the table, and the attendants went
to the king to complain of the loss of the article which
they themselves had hidden. It often enough happens
that one who blushes at a false insinuation has less control
of his countenance than one who is really guilty.
Dioxippus could not bear the glances which were turned
upon him as if he were the thief, and so when he had left
the banquet he wrote a letter which he addressed to the
king, and then killed himself with his sword. The king
took his death much to heart, judging that the man had
killed himself from sheer indignation, and not from remorse
of conscience, especially since the intemperate joy of his
enemies made it clear that he had been falsely accused.</p>

<p>The Indian ambassadors were dismissed to their several

territories of the Malli.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Thence he marched towards the
Sabarcae,<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> a powerful Indian tribe where the form of
government was democratic and not regal. Their army
consisted of 60,000 foot and 6000 cavalry attended by
500 chariots.</p>

<p>They had elected three generals renowned for their
valour and military skill; but when those who lived near
the river, the banks of which were most thickly studded
with their villages,<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> saw the whole river as far as the eye
could reach covered with ships, and saw besides the many
thousands of men and their gleaming arms, they took
fright at the strange spectacle and imagined that an army
of the gods and a second Father Bacchus, a name famous
in that country, were coming into their midst. The
shouts of the soldiers and the noise of the oars, together
with the confused voices of the sailors encouraging each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
other, so filled their alarmed ears that they all ran off to
the army and cried out to the soldiers that they would be
mad to offer battle to the gods, that the number of ships
carrying these invincible warriors was past all counting.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
By these reports they created such a terror in the ranks
of their own army that they sent ambassadors commissioned
to surrender their whole nation to Alexander.</p>

<p>Having received their submission, he came on the fourth
day after to other tribes which had as little inclination for
fighting as their neighbours. Here therefore he built a
town, which by his orders was called Alexandrea,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and
then he entered the country of the people known as the
Musicani.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> While he was here he held an enquiry into
the complaints advanced by the Parapamisadae against
Terioltes,<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> whom he had made their satrap, and, finding
many charges of extortion and tyranny proved against
him, he sentenced him to death. On the other hand
Oxyartes, the governor of the Bactriani, was not only
acquitted, but, as he had claims upon Alexander’s affections,
was rewarded with an extension of the territory
under his jurisdiction. Having thereafter reduced the
Musicani, Alexander put a garrison into their capital, and
marched thence into the country of the Praesti, another
Indian tribe.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Their king was Porticanus, and he with a
great body of his countrymen had shut himself up within
a strongly-fortified city. Alexander, however, took it after
a three days’ siege. Porticanus, who had taken refuge
within the citadel after the capture of the city, sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
deputies to the king to arrange about terms of capitulation.
Before they reached him, however, two towers had
fallen down with a dreadful crash, and the Macedonians
having made their way through the ruins into the citadel,
captured it and slew Porticanus, who with a few others
had offered resistance.</p>

<p>Having demolished the citadel and sold all the
prisoners, he marched into the territories of King Sambus,
where he received the submission of numerous towns.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
The strongest, however, of all the cities which belonged to
this people, he took by making a passage into it underground.
To the barbarians, who had no previous knowledge
of this device for entering fortified places, it seemed
as if a miracle had been wrought when they saw armed
men rise out of the ground in the middle of their city
almost without any trace of the mine by which they
had entered being visible.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Clitarchus says that 80,000
Indians were slain in that part of the country, and that
numerous prisoners were sold as slaves. The Musicani
again rebelled, and Pithon being sent to crush them,
brought the chief of the tribe, who was also the author of
the insurrection, to the king, who ordered him to be crucified,
and then returned to the river, where the fleet was
waiting for him.</p>

<p>The fourth day thereafter he sailed down the river to a
town that lay at the very extremity of the kingdom of
Sambus. That prince had but lately surrendered himself
to Alexander, but the people of the city refused to obey
him, and had even closed their gates against him. The
king, however, despising the paucity of their numbers,
ordered 500 Agrianians to go close up to the walls and
then to retire by little, in order to entice the enemy
from the town, who would in that case certainly pursue
under the belief that they were retreating. The Agrianians,
after some skirmishing, suddenly showed their backs to
the enemy as they had been ordered, and were hotly pursued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
by the barbarians, who fell in with other troops led
by the king in person. The fighting was therefore
renewed, with the result that out of the 3000 barbarians
who were in the action, 600 were killed, 1000 taken
prisoners, and the rest driven back into the city. But
this victory did not end so happily as at first sight it
promised to do, for the barbarians had used poisoned
swords, and the wounded soon afterwards died; while the
surgeons were at a loss to discover why a slight wound
should be incurable, and followed by so violent a death.
The barbarians had been in hopes that the king, who
was known to be rash and reckless of his safety, might be
in this way cut off, and in fact it was only by sheer good
luck that he escaped untouched, fighting as he did among
the very foremost.</p>

<p>Ptolemy was wounded in the left shoulder, slightly
indeed, but yet dangerously on account of the poison, and
his case caused the king especial anxiety. He was his
own kinsman; some even believed that Philip was his
father, and it is at all events certain that he was the son
of one of that king’s mistresses. He was a member of
the royal body-guard, and the bravest of soldiers. At the
same time, he was even greater and more illustrious in
civil pursuits than in war itself. He lived in a plain style
like men of common rank, was liberal in the extreme, easy
too of access, and a man who gave himself none of the
high airs so often assumed by courtiers. These qualities
made it doubtful whether he was more loved by the king
or by his countrymen. At all events, now that his life
was in danger, he was for the first time made aware of the
great affection entertained for him by the Macedonians,
who by this time seem to have presaged the greatness to
which he afterwards rose, for they showed as much solicitude
for him as they did for Alexander himself. Alexander,
again, though fatigued with fighting and anxiety, sat
watching over Ptolemy, and when he wished to take some
rest, did not leave the sick-room, but had his bed brought
into it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>He had no sooner laid himself down than he fell into
a profound sleep, from which, when he awoke, he told his
attendants that in a vision he had seen a creature in the
form of a serpent carrying in its mouth a plant, which it
offered him as an antidote to the poison. He gave
besides such a description of the colour of the plant as
he was sure would enable any one falling in with it to
recognise it. The plant was found soon afterwards, as
many had gone to search for it, and was laid upon the
wound by Alexander himself. The application at once
removed the pain and speedily cicatrised the wound.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
The barbarians finding themselves disappointed of their
first hopes, surrendered themselves and their city.</p>

<p>Alexander marched thence into the Patalian territory.
Its king was Moeres,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> but he had abandoned the town
and fled for safety to the mountains. Alexander then
took possession of the place, and ravaged the surrounding
country, from which he carried off a great booty of sheep
and cattle, besides a great quantity of corn. After this,
taking some natives acquainted with the river to pilot his
way, he sailed down the stream to an island which had
sprung up almost in the middle of the channel.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter IX.—Perils encountered on the voyage down the
western arm of the Indus to the sea—Alexander
returns from the mouth of the river to Patala</i></h5>

<p>Here he was obliged to make a longer stay than he
had anticipated, because the pilots, finding they were not
strictly guarded, had absconded. He then sent out a
party of his men to search for others. They returned
without finding any, but his unquenchable ambition to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
see the ocean and reach the boundaries of the world, made
him entrust his own life and the safety of so many gallant
men to an unknown river without any guides possessed of
the requisite local knowledge. They thus sailed on ignorant
of everything on the way they had to pass. It was entirely
left to haphazard and baseless conjecture how far off they
were from the sea, what tribes dwelt along the banks,
whether the river was placid at its mouth, and whether
it was thereabouts of a depth sufficient for their war-ships.
The only comfort in this rash adventure was a confident
reliance on Alexander’s uniform good fortune. The expedition
had in this manner now proceeded a distance of
400 stadia, when the pilots brought to his notice that
they began to feel sea-air, and that they believed the
ocean was not now far off.</p>

<p>The king, elated by the news, exhorted the sailors to
bend to their oars. The end of their labours, he said, for
which they had always been hoping and praying, was
close at hand; nothing was now wanting to complete
their glory; nothing left to withstand their valour. They
could now, without the hazard of fighting, without any
bloodshed, make the whole world their own. Even nature
herself could advance no farther, and within a short time
they would see what was known to none but the immortal
gods. He nevertheless sent a small party ashore in a
boat in order to take some of the natives straggling about,
from whom he hoped some correct information might be
obtained. After all the huts near the shore had been
searched, some natives at last were found hidden away in
them. These, on being asked how far off the sea was,
answered that they had never so much as heard of such a
thing as the sea, but that on the third day they might
come to water of a bitter taste which corrupted the fresh
water. From this it was understood they meant the sea,
whose nature they did not understand. The mariners
therefore plied their oars with increased alacrity, and still
more strenuously on the following day as they drew
nearer to the fulfilment of their hopes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>On the third day they observed that the sea, coming
up with a tide as yet gentle, began to mingle its brine
with the fresh water of the river. Then they rowed out
to another island that lay in the middle of the river,
making, however, slower progress in rowing since the
stream of the river was now beaten back by the force of
the tide. They put in to the shore of the island, and
such as landed ran hither and thither in quest of provisions,
never dreaming of the mishap which was to overtake
them from their ignorance of tides. It was now
about the third hour of the day when the ocean, undergoing
its periodic change, rose in flood-tide, and began to
burst upon them and force back the current of the river,
which being at first retarded, and then more violently
repelled, was driven upward contrary to its natural direction
with more than the impetuosity of rivers in flood
rushing down precipitous beds. The men in general
were ignorant of the nature of the sea, and so, when they
saw it continually swelling higher, and overflowing the
beach which before was dry, they looked upon this as
something supernatural by which the gods signified their
wrath against their rash presumption.</p>

<p>When the vessels were now fairly floated, and the
whole squadron scattered in different directions, the men
who had gone on shore ran back in consternation to the
ships, confounded beyond measure by a calamity of a
nature so unexpected. But amid the tumult their haste
served only to mar their speed. Some were to be seen
pushing the vessels with poles; others had taken their
seats to row, but in doing so had meanwhile been preventing
the proper adjustment of the oars. Others again,
in hastening to sail out into the clear channel, without
waiting for the requisite number of sailors and pilots,
worked the vessels to little effect, crippled as these were
and otherwise difficult to handle. At the same time
several other vessels drifted away with the stream before
those who were pell-mell crowding into them could all
get on board, and in this case the crowding caused as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
much delay in hurrying off as did the scarcity of hands
in the other vessels. From one side were shouted orders
to stay, from another to put off, so that amid this confusion
of contradictory orders nothing that was of any
service could be seen or even heard. In such an emergency
the pilots themselves were useless, since their
commands could neither be heard for the uproar, nor
executed by men so distracted with terror.</p>

<p>The ships accordingly ran foul of each other, broke
away each other’s oars, and bumped each other’s sterns.
A spectator could not have supposed that what he saw
was the fleet of one and the same army, but rather two
hostile fleets engaged in a sea-fight. Prows were dashed
against poops, and vessels that damaged other vessels in
front of them were themselves damaged in turn by vessels
at their stern. The men, as was but natural, lost their
temper, and from high words fell to blows. By this time
the tide had overflowed all the level lands near the river’s
edge, leaving only sandheaps visible above the water
like so many islands. To these numbers of the men
swam for safety, neglecting through fear the safety of the
vessels they quitted, some of which were riding in very
deep water where depressions existed in the ground, while
others were stranded on shoals where the waves had covered
the more or less elevated parts of the channel. But now
they were suddenly surprised with a new danger, still greater
than the first, for the sea, which had begun to ebb, was
rushing back whence it came with a strong current, and
was rendering back the lands which just before had been
deeply submerged. This pitched some of the stranded
vessels upon their sterns, and caused others to fall upon
their sides, and that too with such violence that the fields
around them were strewn with baggage, arms, broken oars,
and wreckage.</p>

<p>The soldiers, meanwhile, neither dared to trust themselves
to the land nor to leave their ships, as they dreaded
that some calamity, worse than before, might at any
moment befall them. They could scarcely indeed believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
what they saw and experienced, these shipwrecks upon
dry land, and the presence of the sea in the river. Nor
did their misfortunes end here, for as they did not know
that the tide would soon afterwards bring back the sea
and float their ships, they anticipated that they would be
reduced by famine to the most dismal extremities. To
add to their terror monstrous creatures of frightful aspect,
which the sea had left behind it, were seen wandering
about.</p>

<p>As night drew on the hopelessness of the situation
oppressed even the king himself with harassing anxieties.
But no care could ever daunt his indomitable spirit, and
great as was his anxiety it did not prevent him from
remaining all night on the watch and giving out his
orders. He even sent some horsemen to the mouth
of the river with instructions that when they saw the tide
returning they should go before it and announce its
approach. Meanwhile he caused the shattered vessels
to be repaired, and those that were overturned to be set
upright, at the same time ordering the men to be ready
and on the alert when the land would be inundated by
the return of the tide. The whole of that night had
been spent by the king in watching and addressing words
of encouragement to his men, when the horsemen came
back at full gallop, with the tide following at their heels.
It came at first with a gentle current which sufficed to set
the ships afloat, but it soon gathered strength enough to
set the whole fleet in motion. Then the soldiers and
sailors, giving vent to their irrepressible joy at their
unexpected deliverance, made the shores and banks resound
with their exulting cheers. They asked each
other wonderingly wherefrom so vast a sea had suddenly
returned, whereto it had retired the day before, what was
the nature of this strange element, which at one time was
out of harmony with the natural laws of space, but at
another was obedient to some fixed laws in respect of
time?<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> The king conjecturing from what had happened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
that the tide would return after sunrise, took advantage
of it, and starting at midnight sailed down the river
attended by a few ships, and having passed its mouth,
advanced into the sea a distance of 400 stadia, and thus
at last accomplished the object he had so much at heart.
Having then sacrificed to the tutelary gods of the sea and
of the places adjacent, he took the way back to his fleet.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter X.—Alexander goes homeward by land, leaving
Nearchus to follow by sea and conduct the fleet to the
head of the Persian Gulf—Disastrous march through
Gedrosia—Alexander arrives in Carmania, where he
holds Bacchic revels to celebrate his conquests</i></h5>

<p>He sailed thence up the river, and next day reached
a place of anchorage not far from a salt lake,<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> the peculiar
properties of which being unknown to his men, deceived
those who thoughtlessly bathed in its waters. For scabs
broke out over their bodies, and the disease being contagious,
infected even others who had not bathed. The
application of oil, however, cured the sores. Then as the
country through which the army was to pass was dry and
waterless, Alexander sent on Leonnatus in advance to
dig wells, while he remained himself with the troops
where he was, waiting for the arrival of spring. In the
meantime he built a good many cities,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and ordered
Nearchus and Onesicritus, who were experienced navigators,
to sail with the stoutest ships down to the ocean,
and proceeding as far as they could with safety to make
themselves acquainted with the nature of the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
Having done this, they might return to join him by
sailing up either the same river or the Euphrates.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>The winter being now wellnigh over, he burned the
useless ships, and marched homeward with his army by
land. In the course of nine encampments he reached
the land of the Arabites, and in nine more the land of
the Cedrosii—a free people, who agreed to surrender
after holding a council to consider the subject. As they
surrendered voluntarily, nothing was exacted from them
except a supply of provisions. On the fifth day thereafter
he came to a river, which the natives called the
Arabus, and beyond it he found the country barren and
waterless. This he traversed, and so entered the
dominions of the Oritae. Here he gave Hephaestion
the great bulk of the army, and divided the rest of it,
consisting of light-armed troops, between Ptolemy, Leonnatus,
and himself. These three divisions plundered the
Indians simultaneously, and carried off a large booty.
Ptolemy devastated the maritime country, while the king
himself and Leonnatus between them ravaged all the
interior. Here too he built a city, which he peopled
with Arachosians.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Thence he came to those Indians
who inhabit the sea-coast, possessing a great extent of
country, and holding no manner of intercourse even with
their next neighbours.</p>

<p>This isolation from the rest of the world has brutalised
their character, which even by nature is far from humane.
They have long claw-like nails and long shaggy hair, for
they cut the growth of neither. They live in huts constructed
of shells and other offscourings of the sea.
Their clothing consists of the skins of wild beasts, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
they feed on fish dried in the sun, and on the flesh of
sea monsters cast on the shore during stormy weather.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
The Macedonians having by this time consumed all their
provisions, suffered first from scarcity and at last from
hunger, so that they were driven to search everywhere for
the roots of the palm, which is the only tree that country
produces. When even this kind of food failed them, they
began to kill their beasts of burden, and did not spare
even their horses. They were thus deprived of the
means of carrying their baggage, and had to burn the
rich spoils taken from their enemies, for the sake of
which they had marched to the utmost extremities of the
East.</p>

<p>A pestilence succeeded the famine, for the new juices
of the unwholesome esculents on which they fed, superadded
to the fatigue of marching and the strain of their
mental anxiety, had spread various distempers among
them, so that they were threatened with destruction
whether they remained where they were or resumed
their march. If they stayed famine would assail them,
and if they advanced a still deadlier enemy, pestilence,
would have them in its grasp. The plains were in
consequence bestrewn with almost more bodies of the
dying than of the dead. Even those who suffered least
from the distemper could not keep pace with the main
army, because every one believed that the faster he travelled
he advanced the more surely to health and safety. The
men, therefore, whose strength failed craved help from
all and sundry, whether known to them or unknown.
But there were no beasts of burden now by which they
could be taken on, and the soldiers had enough to do to
carry their arms, whilst at the same time the dreadful
figure of the calamity impending over themselves was
ever before their eyes. Being thus repeatedly appealed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
to, they could not so much as bear to cast back a look
at their comrades, their pity for others being lost in their
fears for themselves.</p>

<p>Those, on the other hand, who were thus forsaken,
implored the king, in the name of the gods and by the
rites of their common religion, to help them in their sore
need, and when they found that they vainly importuned
deaf ears, their despair turned to frantic rage, so that
they fell to imprecations, wishing for those who refused
to help them a similar death and similar friends. The
king, feeling himself to be the cause of so great a
calamity, was oppressed with grief and shame, and sent
orders to Phrataphernes, the satrap of the Parthyaeans,<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> to
forward him upon camels provisions ready cooked, and
he also notified his wants to the governors of the adjacent
provinces. In obedience to his orders the supplies were
at once forwarded, and the army being thus rescued,
from famine at least, reached eventually the frontiers of
Cedrosia, a region which alone of all these parts produces
everything in great abundance. Here, therefore, he
halted for some time to refresh his harassed troops by
an interval of repose.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he received a letter from Leonnatus reporting
that he had defeated the Oritae, who had brought
against him a force of 8000 foot and 300 horse. Word
came also from Craterus that he had crushed an incipient
rebellion, instigated by two Persian nobles, Ozines and
Zariaspes, whom he had seized and placed under custody.
On leaving this place Alexander appointed Sibyrtius to
be governor of that province in succession to Memnon,
who had lately been cut off by some malady, and he
then marched into Carmania, which was governed by the
satrap Aspastes, whom he suspected of having designed
to make himself independent while he was a great
distance off in India. Aspastes came to meet Alexander,
who, dissembling his resentment, received him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
graciously, and let him remain in office till he could
inquire into the charges preferred against him. Then
as the different governors, in compliance with his demands,
had sent him a large supply of horses and draught
cattle from their respective provinces, he accommodated
all his men who wanted them with horses and waggons.
He restored also their arms to their former splendour,
for they were now not far from Persia, which was a rich
country and in the enjoyment of profound peace.</p>

<p>So then Alexander, whose soul aspired to more than
human greatness, since he had rivalled, as we said before,
the glory which Father Bacchus had achieved by his
conquest of India, resolved also to match his reputation
by imitating the Bacchanalian procession which that
divinity first invented, whether that was a triumph or
merely some kind of frolic with which his Bacchanals
amused themselves. To this end he ordered the streets
through which he was to pass to be strewn with flowers
and chaplets, and beakers and other capacious vessels
brimming with wine to be placed at all the house doors.
Then he ordered waggons to be made, each capable of
holding many soldiers, and these to be decorated like
tents, some with white canvas and others with costly
tapestry.</p>

<p>The king headed the procession with his friends and
the members of his select body-guard, wearing on their
heads chaplets made of a variety of flowers. The strains
of music were to be heard in every part of the procession,
here the breathings of the flute, and there the warblings
of the lyre. All the army followed, feasting and carousing
as they rode in the waggons, which they had
decorated as gaily as they possibly could, and had hung
round with their choicest and showiest weapons. The
king himself and the companions of his revelry rode in a
chariot, which groaned under the weight of goblets of
gold and large drinking cups made of the same precious
metal. The army for seven days advanced in this
bacchanalian fashion, so that it might have fallen an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
easy prey to the vanquished if they had but had a spark
of spirit to attack it when in this drunken condition.
Why, a thousand men only, if with some mettle in them
and sober, could have captured the whole army in the
midst of its triumph, besotted as it was with its seven
days’ drunken debauch.</p>

<p>But fortune, which assigns to every thing its fame and
value in the world’s estimation, turned into glory this
gross military scandal; and the contemporaries of Alexander,
as well as those who came after his time, regarded it as a
wonderful achievement, that his soldiers, though drunk,
passed in safety through nations hardly as yet sufficiently
subdued, the barbarians taking, what was in reality a
piece of great temerity, to be a display of well-grounded
confidence.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> All this grand exhibition, however, had the
executioner in its wake, for the satrap Aspastes, of whom
we before made mention, was ordered to be put to death.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
So true is it that cruelty is no obstacle to the indulgence
of luxury, nor luxury to the indulgence of cruelty.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXXXIV.—Alexander at Massaga—His
treachery towards the Indian mercenaries who had
capitulated</i></h5>

<p>When the capitulation on those terms had been
ratified by oaths, the Queen [of Massaga], to show her
admiration of Alexander’s magnanimity, sent out to him
most valuable presents, with an intimation that she would
fulfil all the stipulations. Then the mercenaries at
once, in accordance with the terms of the agreement,
evacuated the city, and after retiring to a distance of
eighty stadia, pitched their camp unmolested without
thought of what was to happen. But Alexander, who
was actuated by an implacable enmity against the
mercenaries, and had kept his troops under arms ready
for action, pursued the barbarians, and falling suddenly
upon them, made a great slaughter of their ranks. The
barbarians at first loudly protested that they were
attacked in violation of sworn obligations, and invoked
the gods whom he had desecrated by taking false oaths
in their name. But Alexander with loud voice retorted
that his covenant merely bound him to let them depart
from the city, and was by no means a league of perpetual
amity between them and the Macedonians. The mercenaries,
undismayed by the greatness of their danger, drew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
their ranks together in form of a ring, within which they
placed the women and children to guard them on all
sides against their assailants. As they were now
desperate, and by their audacity and feats of valour,
made the conflict in which they closed hot work for the
enemy, while the Macedonians held it a point of honour
not to be outdone in courage by a horde of barbarians,
great was the astonishment and alarm which the peril of
the crisis created. For as the combatants were locked
together fighting hand to hand, death and wounds were
dealt round in every variety of form. Thus the Macedonians,
when once their long spikes had shattered the
shields of the barbarians, pierced their vitals with the
steel points of these weapons, and on the other hand the
mercenaries never hurled their javelins without deadly
effect against the near mark presented by the dense ranks
of the enemy. When many were thus wounded and not
a few killed, the women, taking the arms of the fallen,
fought side by side with the men, for the imminence of
the danger and the great interests at stake forced them
to do violence to their nature, and to take an active part
in the defence. Accordingly some of them who had
supplied themselves with arms, did their best to cover
their husbands with their shields, while others who were
without arms did much to impede the enemy by flinging
themselves upon them and catching hold of their shields.
The defenders, however, after fighting desperately along
with their wives, were at last overpowered by superior
numbers, and met a glorious death which they would
have disdained to exchange for a life with dishonour.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
Alexander spared the unwarlike and unarmed multitude,
as well as the women that still survived, but took them
away under charge of the cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXXXV.—Alexander captures the rock Aornos</i></h5>

<p>He took many other cities, and put to death all who
offered resistance to his arms. He then advanced to the
rock called Aornos, unto which such of the inhabitants as
survived had fled for refuge, because it was a stronghold
of incomparable security.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Heraklês, it is said, had in
the days of old assaulted this rock, but had abandoned
the siege on the occurrence of violent earthquakes and
signs from heaven. Now, when this story came to Alexander’s
ears, it only whetted his eagerness to attack the
stronghold, and match himself against the god in a contest
for glory. The rock was 100 stadia in circuit, 16
stadia in height, and had a level surface, forming a complete
circle. On its southern side it was washed by the
Indus, the greatest of Indian rivers, but elsewhere it was
all environed with deep ravines and inaccessible cliffs.
When Alexander, who perceived the difficult nature of the
ground, had given up all hope of taking the place by
assault, there came to him an old man accompanied by
his two sons. He was miserably poor, this man, and had
lived a long time in that neighbourhood, inhabiting a cave
with three lairs cut into the rock, which served as night-quarters
for himself and his sons. He had thus a familiar
knowledge of all that locality. This old man then, coming
to the king, explained to him what his circumstances
were, and undertook to guide his army up the difficult
ascent, and take him to a position which commanded the
barbarians in occupation of the rock. Alexander promised
the man an ample recompense for this service, and
in following his guidance seized in the first place the
narrow pass which alone gave access to the rock, and, as
there was no exit from it elsewhere, he so closely blocked
up the enemy that no assistance could possibly reach
them from any quarter. In the next place he set all his
men to work to fill up with a mound the ravine which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
lay at the root of the rock. Having thus got nearer the
place, he pushed the siege with all possible vigour, making
assaults for seven days and as many nights without intermission,
the troops taking duty by turns. The advantage,
however, lay at first with the barbarians, who fought from
a higher position, and killed many who pressed the attack
too recklessly. But when the mound had been completed,
and catapults which shot bolts to a great distance and
other engines of war had been brought to bear against
them, and when it became manifest besides that the king
would by no means abandon the siege, the Indians were
struck with despair. Alexander, whose sagacity foresaw
what would occur, withdrew the guard which he had left
at the pass, thus giving the men on the rock, if they
wished to retire, a free passage out. So then the barbarians,
dismayed alike by the valour of the Macedonians
and the king’s fixed ambition to be master of the place,
evacuated the rock by night.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXXXVI.—Alexander crosses the Indus, and is
hospitably received by Taxilês</i></h5>

<p>Alexander having thus outwitted the Indians by these
feints, obtained possession of the rock without risk being
incurred. He then gave his guide the stipulated reward,
and moved off with his army at the very time when
Aphrikês, an Indian who had 20,000 soldiers and 15
elephants, was hovering about in that locality.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> This
man certain of his followers put to death, and, having
brought his head to Alexander, procured for this service
their own safety. The king took them into his own ranks,
and got possession of the elephants, which were wandering
at large about the country.</p>

<p>He then came to the river Indus, and, finding that the
thirty-oared galleys which he ordered had been prepared,
and the passage bridged, he gave his army a rest of thirty
days to recruit their strength. Having then offered to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
the gods sacrifices on a magnificent scale, he led his army
over to the other side, where he met with an incident
which took a strange and unexpected turn. For Taxilês
being by this time dead, his son Môphis<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> had succeeded to
the government. Now Môphis had before this not only
sent word to Alexander, then in Sogdiana, that he would
fight on his side against any Indians who might appear
in arms against him, but at this juncture had also sent
ambassadors to say that he surrendered his kingdom into
his hands. So when Alexander was at a distance of forty
stadia he set forth to meet him, attended by his friends,
and his army drawn up in battle order and his elephants
ranged in line. Alexander, seeing a great host advancing
towards him drawn up as if for action, thought that the
Indian had treacherously offered to surrender that he
might thus fall upon the Macedonians before they could
prepare for battle. He therefore ordered the trumpeters
to sound to arms, and, having marshalled his troops,
advanced to give the Indians battle. But Môphis, on
seeing the commotion in the Macedonian ranks, and comprehending
its cause, left his army, and riding forward
with a few of his friends, corrected the mistake into which
the Macedonians had fallen, and surrendered himself and
his army to the king. Alexander, to mark his approbation
of this conduct, gave back his kingdom to Môphis,
and ever afterwards treated him as a friend and ally.
He also changed his name to Taxilês.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXXXVII.—Alexander marches against Pôros—The
appearance presented by the Indian army with
its elephants</i></h5>

<p>Such were the transactions of this year—that in which
Chremês was archon at Athens, and in which the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
appointed Publius Cornelius and Aulus Postumius consuls.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
Thereafter Alexander, who had recruited his army by an
interval of rest in the country of Taxilês, took the field
against Pôros, the king of the neighbouring Indians, who
had an army of more than 50,000 foot, about 3000 horse,
above 1000 chariots, and 130 elephants. This king had
made an alliance with another prince called Embisaros,<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
the ruler of an adjacent tribe, and who possessed an army
which was but little inferior to his own. Alexander, on
learning that this king was 400 stadia distant, resolved to
attack Pôros before his ally could reach him. Pôros, being
warned of the near approach of the enemy, at once drew
up his troops in order of battle. His cavalry he distributed
on the wings, and his elephants he placed in his front
line at equi-distances, and so arranged as to strike the
enemy with terror. In the intervals between the animals
he stationed the rest of his soldiers, instructing them to
succour the elephants and protect them from being assailed
in flank by the enemy’s missiles. The whole disposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
of his army gave it very much the appearance of a city—the
elephants as they stood resembling its towers, and the
men-at-arms placed between them resembling the lines of
wall intervening between tower and tower. But Alexander,
having observed how the forces of the enemy had been
disposed, regulated thereby the formation of his own line.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXXXVIII.—The defeat of Pôros</i></h5>

<p>The Macedonian cavalry began the action, and
destroyed nearly all the chariots of the Indians. Upon
this the elephants, applying to good use their prodigious
size and strength, killed some of the enemy by trampling
them under their feet, and crushing their armour and
their bones, while upon others they inflicted a terrible
death, for they first lifted them aloft with their trunks,
which they had twined round their bodies, and then
dashed them down with great violence to the ground.
Many others they deprived in a moment of life by goring
them through and through with their tusks. But the
Macedonians heroically bore the brunt of this dreadful
onslaught, and having killed with their long pikes the
men stationed between the elephants, made the poise of
the battle equal. They next assailed the animals themselves
with a storm of javelins, thus piercing them with
numerous wounds, which so tortured them that the Indians
mounted on their backs lacked sufficient strength to
control their movements, for the animals on heading to
their own ranks bore against them with an impetuosity
not to be repressed, and trampled their own friends under
their feet. Then ensued a great confusion, but Pôros,
who was mounted on the most powerful of all his
elephants, on seeing what had happened, gathered around
him forty of the animals that were still under control,
and falling upon the enemy with all the weight of the
elephants, made a great slaughter with his own hand, for
he far surpassed in bodily strength any soldier of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
army. In stature he measured five cubits, while his girth
was such that his breastplate was twice the size required
for a man of ordinary bulk. For this reason the javelins
he flung from his hand flew with all but the impetus of
shots from a catapult. The Macedonians who stood
opposed to him being terror-struck at his astonishing
prowess, Alexander sent to their assistance the archers
and the divisional light troops, with orders that every
man should make Pôros the object of his aim. The
soldiers lost no time in carrying out these orders. Their
bolts flew thick and fast, and as the Indian king at whom
they were all aimed presented a broad mark, none of
them failed to carry home. Pôros fought on with heroic
courage, but being drained of blood by the number of his
wounds, he fainted away, and leaning on his elephant for
support, was borne to the ground. A report having
spread that their king was dead, the remnant of the
Indian host fled from the field, but many of them were
slain in the flight.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXXXIX.—Losses sustained by each side in the
battle of the Hydaspês—Alexander orders a fleet to be
built on the Hydaspês.</i></h5>

<p>Alexander having gained this splendid victory, recalled
his soldiers from the field by sound of trumpet. In this
engagement more than 12,000 of the Indians fell, among
whom were two of the sons of Pôros, and his generals, and
the most distinguished of his other officers. More than
9000 men were taken prisoners, and eighty elephants
were captured. Pôros himself, who was still alive, was
given into the hands of the Indians to be cured of his
wounds. Of the Macedonians, there fell 280 horsemen and
more than 700 foot-soldiers. The king buried the dead,
and in proportion to their merits rewarded those who had
signalised themselves by their bravery in the action. He
then sacrificed to the Sun, as the deity who had given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
him the conquest of the eastern parts of the world. As
the mountainous country adjacent produced much well-grown
fir, and not a little cedar and pine, besides an
unlimited quantity of other kinds of timber fit for building
ships, he prepared what ships he required. For he
intended, after he had reached the limits of India and
subdued all its inhabitants, to sail down stream to the
ocean. He founded two cities, one beyond the river at
the place where he crossed, and the other on the field
where he had defeated Pôros.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> The work of building the
ships was quickly finished, owing to the great number of
hands employed on it; and he then appointed Pôros, who
had recovered from his wounds, in consideration of the
valour he had displayed, to be king of the country over
which he had formerly ruled. He then gave his army
thirty days to recruit in this region, which yielded an
unstinted supply of all the necessaries of life.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XC.—Some account of the serpents, apes, and trees
seen by the Macedonians in India</i></h5>

<p>In the mountainous country which adjoined the scene
of action there were found other peculiar products besides
timber for shipbuilding, for it abounded with snakes of an
extraordinary size, being sixteen cubits in length,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> and
with many kinds of apes, which also were remarkable for
their size. The apes of themselves suggested what
stratagem should be employed in hunting them, for they
are prone to imitate whatever they see men doing, but
yet are not easily overpowered by mere force, since they
are possessed both of great strength of body and sharpness
of wit. Some members, therefore, of the hunting
party smear their eyes with honey, others in full view of
their game put on their shoes, while others hang mirrors
around their necks. Then, having affixed nooses to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
shoes, they leave these behind them, and in place of the
honey they substitute gum, and at the same time attach
hauling-ropes to the mirrors. So when the apes try to do
all that they had seen done by the men they find themselves
powerless to do so, for their eyelids are glued
together, their feet entangled in the nooses, and their
bodies held fast by the ropes. In these circumstances
they fall an easy prey to the hunters.</p>

<p>Alexander having struck terror into the king called
Embisaros, who had come too late to the assistance of
Pôros, compelled him to do what he commanded. Having
then crossed the river with his army, he advanced through
a country of surpassing fertility, for it had various kinds
of trees which rose to a height of seventy cubits, and had
such a girth that it took fully four men to clasp them
round, while their shadow projected to a distance of
300 feet. This region also was much infested with
snakes. These were small in size, and marked with
diverse colours, for while some were like bronze-coloured
wands, others had a thick hair-like mane, and with their
sting inflicted a death of acute pain, for the sufferings of
any one they bit were dreadful, and were accompanied
with a flux of sweat which looked like blood. On this
account the Macedonians, being terribly plagued by their
stings, suspended their couches from the trees, and kept
awake the greater part of the night; but when they had
learned from the natives that a certain root was an antidote,
its application relieved them from their sufferings.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter XCI.—Alexander pursues Pôros, nephew of the great
Pôros—Subdues the Adrestai and Kathaians and
enters the kingdom of Sôpeithês—Peculiar customs of
the natives of these parts</i></h5>

<p>When he moved forward with his forces certain men
came to inform him that Pôros, the king of the country,
who was the nephew of that Pôros whom he had defeated,
had quitted his kingdom and fled to the nation of the
Gandaridai. Alexander, irritated at the news, despatched
Hêphaistiôn into his country with a body of troops and
ordered him to hand over the kingdom to the other Pôros
who was on his side. He then marched in person against
the Adrestai,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> and having reduced some of their cities
which offered resistance, and persuaded others to surrender,
he invaded the country of the Kathaians, a people among
whom the custom prevailed that widows should be burned
along with their husbands, the barbarians having put in
force a decree to this effect because an instance had
occurred of a wife procuring her husband’s death by
poison.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> The king laid siege to their greatest and
strongest city and burned it to the ground, in revenge for
the many dangers incurred in capturing it. While he was
besieging another considerable city the Indians in a suppliant
manner entreated his mercy and he spared them
accordingly.</p>

<p>He next warred against the cities that were subject to
the sway of Sôpeithês.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> These were governed by laws in
the highest degree salutary, for while in other respects
their political system was one to admire, beauty was held
among them in the highest estimation. For this reason a
discrimination between the children born to them is made
at the stage of infancy, when those that are perfect in
their limbs and features, and have constitutions which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
promise a combination of strength and beauty, are allowed
to be reared, while those that have any bodily defect are
condemned to be destroyed as not worth the rearing.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
They make their marriages also in accordance with this
principle, for in selecting a bride they care nothing whether
she has a dowry and a handsome fortune besides, but look
only to her beauty and other advantages of the outward
person. It follows that the inhabitants of these cities are
generally held in higher estimation than the rest of their
countrymen. Their king Sôpeithês,
who was admired by all for his beauty
and his stature, which exceeded four
cubits, came forth from the city where
his palace was, and on surrendering
himself and his kingdom to Alexander
was reinstated in his authority by the
clemency of the conqueror. Sôpeithês with the utmost
cordiality feasted the whole army in splendid style for
several days.</p>

</div>

<h5><i>Chapter XCII.—Courage and ferocity of the dogs in
the dominions of Sôpeithês</i></h5>

<p>Among the many valuable presents which he bestowed
on Alexander were 150 dogs remarkable for their size and
strength, and superior also in other points, and said to
have been bred from tigresses.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Being desirous that
Alexander should have proof of their mettle by seeing
them at work, he placed a full-grown lion within an
enclosure, and selecting two of the least valuable of the
dogs included in the present, cast them to the lion. When
these were likely to be vanquished by the wild beast he let
loose other two dogs. Then when the four dogs together
proved more than a match for the lion, a man who was
sent into the ring with a knife cut away the right leg of
one of the dogs. When the king loudly remonstrated,
and his body-guards rushed forward and arrested the hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
of the Indian, Sôpeithês announced that he would give
three dogs instead of the one which was mutilated. Then
the huntsman, taking hold of the leg, cut it away quietly
bit by bit. The dog, without uttering so much as a yell
or a moan of pain, kept his fangs fixed in the bite, until
all his blood being drained he drew his last breath on the
body of the lion.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XCIII.—Submission of Phêgeus—Advance to the
Hypanis—Description given by Phêgeus of the country
beyond the Hypanis—Of the Praisians and their king
Xandrames</i></h5>

<p>During these transactions Hêphaistiôn, who had made
large conquests of Indian territory with the expedition
under his command, rejoined Alexander, who, after having
praised that general for his valour and devotion to
his service, then led his army into the dominions of
Phêgeus.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Here, as the natives welcomed the presence
of the Macedonians, and Phêgeus came out with many
gifts to meet them, Alexander consented to let him retain
his kingdom. Then having for two days enjoyed along
with his army the noble hospitality of this prince, he
advanced toward the Hypanis,<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> a river with a width of
seven stadia, a depth of six fathoms, and a violent
current which made its passage difficult. He had obtained
from Phêgeus a description of the country beyond the
Indus: First came a desert which it would take twelve
days to traverse; beyond this was the river called the
Ganges which had a width of thirty-two stadia, and a
greater depth than any other Indian river; beyond this
again were situated the dominions of the nation of the
Praisioi and the Gandaridai,<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> whose king, Xandrames, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
an army of 20,000 horse, 200,000 infantry, 2000 chariots,
and 4000 elephants trained and equipped for war.
Alexander, distrusting these statements, sent for Pôros
and questioned him as to their accuracy. Pôros assured
him of the correctness of the information, but added that
the king of the Gandaridai was a man of quite worthless
character, and held in no respect, as he was thought to be
the son of a barber.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> This man—the king’s father—was
of a comely person, and of him the queen had become
deeply enamoured. The old king having been treacherously
murdered by his wife, the succession had devolved
on him who now reigned. Alexander, though sensible of
the difficulties which would attend an expedition against
the Gandaridai, had nevertheless no thought of swerving
from the path of his ambition, but having in his favour
the courage of the Macedonians and the responses of the
oracles, he was buoyed up with the hope that he would
conquer the barbarians, for had not the Pythian priestess
pronounced him invincible, and had not Ammôn promised
him the dominion of the whole world?<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter XCIV.—Miserable condition of the Macedonian
army—Its refusal to advance beyond the Hypanis</i></h5>

<p>He saw, however, that his soldiers were dispirited by
interminable campaigns, and by their exposure for nearly
eight years to toils and dangers reduced to a condition
of the utmost misery, and he therefore conceived it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
necessary for him to animate his troops for the expedition
against the Gandaridai<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> by plying them with suitable
arguments. For death had made severe ravages in his
ranks, and all hope was gone that his wars would ever
come to an end. Then their horses’ hoofs had been worn
off by ceaseless marches, and their weapons worn out by
use. The Hellenic costumes again were by this time
threadbare and could not be replaced, and hence the men
were obliged to use cloth woven in barbaric looms wherewith
to cut out such dresses for themselves as were worn
by Indians. It also so happened that violent storms of
rain burst from the clouds for the space of seventy days,
accompanied with continual outbreaks of thunder and
lightning. Alexander, considering this state of things an
obstacle to his designs, placed all his hopes of gaining his
ends on winning by benefactions the hearty support of his
soldiers. Accordingly he allowed them to plunder the
enemy’s country where supplies of all sorts abounded, and
on those days when the army was busily engaged in
foraging he called together the soldiers’ wives and children,
and then promised to give the women an allowance of
food month by month, and the children a donative according
to the calculations of what their fathers received as
the pay of their military rank. When the soldiers who
had found a rich and ample booty returned to the camp,
he gathered them all together, and in a well-weighed
speech addressed the assembly on the subject of the
expedition against the Gandaridai; but when the Macedonians
would by no means assent to his proposals he
renounced his contemplated enterprise.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XCV.—Alexander erects altars and other memorials
near the Hypanis, and returns to the Akesinês</i></h5>

<p>He then resolved to set up marks to indicate the
limits to which he had advanced; so first of all he built<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
altars to the twelve gods of 50 cubits in height. Having
next enclosed an encampment thrice the size of the one he
occupied, he dug round it a trench 50 feet broad and 40
feet deep, and with the earth cast up from this trench
he erected a rampart of extraordinary dimensions. He
further ordered quarters to be constructed as for foot-soldiers,
each containing two beds 5 cubits in length for
each man, and besides this accommodation, two stalls of
twice the ordinary size for each horseman. Whatever
else was to be left behind was directed to be likewise
proportionately increased in size. His object in all this
was not merely to make a camp as for heroes, but at the
same time to leave among the people of the country
tokens of mighty men to show with what enormous
bodily strength they were endowed. When these works
were finished he retraced his steps with all his army to
the river Akesinês.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> On reaching it he found that the
boats had been built, and when he had rigged these out,
he ordered an additional number to be constructed. At
this time there arrived from Greece allies and mercenaries
led by the generals in command of the allies, amounting
to more than 30,000 foot and not much less than 6000
cavalry. Splendid full suits of armour besides were
brought for the infantry to the number of 25,000,<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> and
100 talents of medicinal drugs, all which he distributed
among the soldiers. When the equipment of the fleet
was finished, and 200 boats without hatches and 800
tenders had been got ready, he proceeded to give names
to the cities which had been founded on the banks of the
river, calling one Nikaia in commemoration of his victory,
and the other Boukephala after his horse that perished
in the battle with Pôros.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XCVI.—Voyage to the Southern Ocean begun—Submission
of the Siboi—The Agalassians attacked
and conquered</i></h5>

<p>Alexander now embarked with his friends, and started
on the voyage to the Southern Ocean. The bulk of the
army simultaneously marched along the banks of the
river under the command of Krateros and Hêphaistiôn.
On coming to the place where the Akesinês and Hydaspês
join each other the king landed his troops, and led them
against a people called the Siboi. These, it is said, were
descended from the soldiers who, under Heraklês, attacked
the rock Aornos, and after failing to capture it were
settled by him in this part of the country. Alexander
encamped near their capital, and thereupon the citizens
who filled the highest offices came forth to meet him,
and reminded him how they were connected by the ties
of a common origin. They avowed themselves to be, in
virtue of their kinship, ready and willing to do whatever
he might require, and presented him also with magnificent
gifts. Alexander was so gratified by their professions of
goodwill that he permitted their cities to remain in the
enjoyment of their freedom.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> He then advanced his
arms against their next neighbours; and finding that the
people called Agalassians<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> had mustered an army of
40,000 foot and 3000 horse, he gave them battle, and
proving victorious put the greater number of them to the
sword. The rest, who had fled for safety to the adjacent
towns, which were soon captured, he condemned to
slavery. The remainder of the inhabitants had been
collected into one place, and he seized 20,000 of them,
who had taken refuge in a large city, which he stormed.
The Indians, however, having barricaded the narrow
streets, fought with great vigour from the houses, so that
Alexander in pressing the attack lost not a few Macedonians.
This enraged him, and he set fire to the city,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
burning with it most of its defenders.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> He gave quarter,
however, to 3000 of the survivors, who had fled for
refuge to the citadel and sued for mercy.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XCVII.—Disaster to the fleet at the confluence of
the rivers</i></h5>

<p>He again embarked with his friends, and sailed down
stream as far as the confluence of the Indus with the two
rivers already mentioned. These mighty streams met
with tumultuous roar, and formed at their junction many
formidable eddies, which destroyed whatever sailing craft
were sucked into their vortex. The current besides was
so swift and strong that it baffled all the skill of the
pilots. Two ships of war foundered in consequence, and
of the other vessels not a few were stranded. A furious
surge broke over the admiral’s ship itself—a mishap
which nearly proved fatal to the king. Wherefore, as
death itself stared him in the face, he stripped off his
clothes, and in his naked condition clung to anything
that offered a chance of safety. His friends were at
the same time swimming alongside the ship, every one
eager to receive the king in the event of its capsizing.
The utmost confusion prevailed on board, the men contending
with the force of the current, and the river
baffling all human skill and endeavour, so that it was
with the greatest difficulty Alexander made the shore, on
which he was cast along with the vessels. For this unexpected
deliverance he offered sacrifice to the gods for
his escape from extreme peril after contending, like
Achilles, with a river.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter XCVIII.—Combination of the Syrakousai and
Malloi—Alexander, neglecting the warning of a soothsayer,
attacks their stronghold, and scales the walls of
its citadel</i></h5>

<p>He undertook next an expedition against the Syrakousai<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
and the people called the Malloi, two populous
and warlike nations. The inhabitants, he found, had
mustered a force of 80,000 foot, 10,000 horse, and 700
chariots. Before Alexander’s coming they had been at
feud with each other, but on his approach had settled
their differences, and cemented an alliance by intermarriage,
each nation taking and giving in exchange
10,000 of their young women for wives.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> They did not,
however, combine their forces and take the field, for as a
dispute had arisen about the leadership, they had drawn
off into the adjoining towns. Alexander, while approaching
the city that first came in his way, was pondering
how he could lay siege to it and capture it at the very
first assault, when one of the soothsayers, named
Dêmophôn, came to him and said that he had been
forewarned by certain omens that the king in besieging
the place would be very dangerously wounded, and he
therefore advised Alexander to let that city alone for the
present, and meanwhile turn his attention to other enterprises.
But the king sharply rebuked him for hampering
the valour of men in the heat of action. He then made
arrangements for the conduct of the siege, and he led
himself the way to the city, which he was ambitious to
reduce at once by a vigorous assault. The battering
train was, however, late in coming up, and he was himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
the first to burst open a postern, and by this side
entrance get into the city. He then cut down many of
the defenders, put the rest to flight, and pursued them
into the citadel. As the Macedonians were meanwhile
detained fighting at the wall, he seized a ladder, and
applying it to the rampart of the fortress, began to mount
it, holding the while his shield above his head. He
climbed up with such activity that he quickly reached
the top, and surprised the barbarians who were stationed
there on guard. The Indians did not venture to close
with him, but assailed him from a distance off with darts
and arrows, so that the king was sorely galled with the
pelting storm of missiles. By this time the Macedonians
had applied to the walls two scaling ladders, up which
they were mounting, when both of them from being
overcrowded broke down, precipitating every one to the
ground.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter XCIX.—Alexander left alone leaps down from the
walls into the citadel, bravely defends himself, but is
dangerously wounded—He is rescued by his friends,
who capture the stronghold—The Greek colonists in
Bactria revolt</i></h5>

<p>The king being thus isolated from all help, performed
a feat of marvellous audacity, which well deserves to be
put on record. For, thinking it would be unworthy of
his characteristic good fortune if he retired from the walls
to his men leaving his purpose unaccomplished, he leaped
down, arms and all, alone as he was, into the citadel.
The Indians hastened up to assail him, but with undaunted
courage he sustained the brunt of their onslaught.
Protecting himself on his right hand by the shelter of a
tree rooted by the wall, and on the left by the wall itself,
he thus kept the Indians at bay, firmly fixed in his purpose
to bear himself right gallantly like a king by whom
such great things had been achieved, and ambitious to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
make the close of his life the most glorious of his whole
career, for numerous were the blows which he received on
his helmet, nor few were those which he caught on his
shield. At last, however, being hit by an arrow under
the pap, he sank on his knee, overcome by the force
of the blow. The Indian who had shot the arrow
immediately sprang forward, thinking lightly of the danger,
but while he was fetching down a blow, Alexander smote
him with his sword under the ribs, and, as the wound was
mortal, the barbarian fell. Then the king, grasping a
branch within reach of his hand, and raising himself up
with it, challenged any of the Indians who so wished to
come forward and fight him. Just at this crisis Peukestas,
one of the hypaspists, who had mounted by a different
ladder, was the first who succeeded in covering the king
with his shield. After him many others appeared on the
scene, who terrified the barbarians and saved Alexander.
The city was then stormed, and the Macedonians, in their
rage for what the king had suffered, slew all whom they
could anywhere find, and filled the city with dead bodies.
While the king’s attention was for many days absorbed
with the curing of his wound, the Greek colonists of
Bactria and Sogdiana, who had long felt it a great
grievance to be settled among barbarians, when they
heard at that time that the king had died of a wound,
revolted from the Macedonians, and, having mustered to
the number of 3000, set out on their return home. They
had many sufferings to endure on the way, and they were
subsequently put to death by the Macedonians after Alexander’s
death.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter C.—Alexander recovers from his wound—Combat
between Koragos and Dioxippos—Dioxippos becomes
victor</i></h5>

<p>Alexander, on being cured of his wound, gave thank-offerings
to the gods for his recovery, and entertained his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
friends with great banquets. During the revels a noteworthy
incident occurred. Among the invited guests was
a Macedonian called Koragos,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> who was remarkable for
his great bodily strength and the number of his brave
exploits in war. This man, in an access of drunken
bravado, challenged to single combat the Athenian
Dioxippos, a prize-fighter, who had been crowned at
the public games for victories of the highest distinction.
The guests present at the carousal naturally were interested
in the match, and Dioxippos having accepted
the challenge, the king fixed the day on which the
combat should come off. At the time appointed for the
match the people thronged in tens of thousands to witness
the spectacle. The Macedonians, who were of the same
race with Koragos, and the king himself joined in showing
their eagerness for the success of their compatriot,
while the Greeks were unanimous in backing up Dioxippos.
The champions advanced into the lists, the Macedonian
arrayed in costly armour, the Athenian naked, rubbed
over with oil, and wearing a close-fitting skull-cap made
of felt. As both men excited the wonder and admiration
of the spectators by the massive strength of their limbs
and their superlative prowess, the contest, it was anticipated,
would be of the nature of a fight between two
gods; for the Macedonian, with his stalwart form and
the dazzling splendour of his arms, which filled the
beholders with amazement, was taken to be like Mars,
while Dioxippos, by his prodigious strength, his practice
in wrestling and carrying the characteristic club, showed
like Heraklês. When they advanced to the attack the
Macedonian from the proper distance discharged his
javelin, but his antagonist, swerving a little aside, eluded
the coming blow. Then the former again advanced with
his long Macedonian pike levelled for the charge, but the
other on seeing him approach sufficiently near, struck the
pike with his club and shattered it to pieces. The Macedonian,
after being thus twice baffled, came on to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
next round intending now to use his sword, but when he
was just on the point of drawing it, Dioxippos unexpectedly
sprang forward, and with his left hand seized the
hand that was drawing the sword, while with his right
hand he pushed Koragos from where he stood, tripped up
his legs, and hurled him to the ground. Then Dioxippos,
planting his foot on his foeman’s neck and lifting up his
club, directed his eyes towards the spectators.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter CI.—The Macedonians plot against Dioxippos, who
in consequence takes away his own life—Alexander’s
regret for his loss</i></h5>

<p>The multitude having loudly applauded the victor for
the supreme courage whereby, contrary to all expectation,
he had won the day, the king ordered him to let his
antagonist go, and then, dismissing the assembly, withdrew
to his tent deeply mortified by the discomfiture of the
Macedonian. Then Dioxippos, letting the fallen man go,
quitted the field with a famous victory and wearing fillets
with which his countrymen had adorned his brows in
gratitude for the honour which he had conferred on all
Greeks in common. Fortune, however, did not allow the
victor any long time to enjoy his triumph, for the king
became more and more alienated from him, and all Alexander’s
friends and all the Macedonians about the court
were so envious of his worth and fame, that they laid a
plot against him, and persuaded the chief steward of the
royal household to hide away one of the golden wine-cups
under his pillow. So at their next banquet when the wine
was served, they charged Dioxippos with theft on the pretence
that the cup had been found in his possession, thus
subjecting him to shame and disgrace. From this he saw
clearly that the Macedonians with one consent had set
themselves against him, and he then rose from the banquet,
and soon afterwards, when within his own chamber, wrote
a letter to Alexander regarding the machinations which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
been formed against him. This letter he entrusted to his
own servants to deliver into the king’s own hands. He
then put an end to his life, and thus, by having inconsiderately
accepted a challenge, terminated his career by
an act of still greater folly. Many of those accordingly
who blamed him for a want of sense, sarcastically remarked
it was a misfortune to have great strength of body and but
a modicum of brain. The king on perusal of the letter
took the man’s end much to heart, and in after times often
regretted the loss of a man of his noble qualities. As he
made no use of him in his lifetime, but felt the want of
him when he was gone, and when regret was unavailing,
he came to know the nobility of the man’s nature from its
contrast to the baseness of his calumniators.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter CII.—The Sambastai, Sodrai, and Massanoi
submit to Alexander, who founds near the banks of
the river a city called Alexandreia—He conquers the
kingdoms of Mousikanos, Portikanos, and Sambos—The
last effects his escape</i></h5>

<p>Alexander having given orders to his army to march
along the river in a line parallel with the course of the
navigation, proceeded on his voyage down stream towards
the ocean, and on reaching the dominions of the Sambastai,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
landed to invade their country. They were a
people inferior to none in India either for numbers or for
bravery. They dwelt in cities in which the democratic
form of government prevailed, and on hearing that the
Macedonians were coming to attack them collected 60,000
foot soldiers, 6000 horse, and 500 chariots. But when
the fleet bore in sight they were thrown into great alarm
by the novelty of the appearance it presented and the
unexpectedness of its presence, and, as they were at the
same time disheartened by the reports which circulated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
about the Macedonians, they adopted the advice of their
elders not to fight, and therefore sent on an embassy consisting
of fifty of their foremost citizens, under the belief
that they would be treated with all proper courtesy. The
king having commended them for coming and expressed
his readiness to make peace with them, was presented by
the inhabitants with gifts of great magnificence, and was
besides accorded heroic honours. He then moved on
towards the tribes called Sodrai<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> and Massanoi,<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> who
occupied the country on both sides of the river, and in
these parts he founded near the river the city of Alexandreia,<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
in which he planted a colony of 10,000 men.
He next reached the dominions of King Mousikanos,
seized that potentate, and, having put him to death, subjugated
his people.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> He next invaded the territories
under the sway of Portikanos, and took two cities at the
first assault, which he permitted the soldiers to sack and
then burned. Portikanos himself fled into a part of the
country which offered means of defence, but in a battle
he was defeated and slain. All the cities subject to his
sceptre Alexander captured and razed to the ground, and
by these severe measures spread consternation among the
surrounding tribes.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> He next plundered the kingdom of
Sambos, and having enslaved and destroyed most of his
cities, put upwards of 80,000 of the barbarians to the
sword.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The nation called the Brahmanoi were involved
in like calamities, but, as the rest sued for mercy, Alexander
punished the most guilty and acquitted the rest of
the offences charged against them. King Sambos escaped
the danger with which he was menaced by taking flight
with thirty elephants into the country beyond the Indus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter CIII.—Harmatelia holds out against Alexander—In
a battle with its inhabitants Ptolemy is wounded by
a poisoned arrow, but is cured by an antidote revealed
to Alexander in a dream</i></h5>

<p>At the extremity of the country of the Brachmans
there lay in the midst of difficult ground the city called
Harmatelia,<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> and as the inhabitants presumed alike on
their valour and the security of their position, Alexander
despatched against them a few light-armed troops, who
were directed to hang on the rear of the enemy, and to
take to flight in case they were attacked. These men
proceeded to attack the ramparts, but being only 500
strong were regarded with contempt. A body therefore of
3000 men under arms sallied out from the city against
these troops, which pretending to be panic-struck, took
to a precipitate flight. But the king with a few followers
stood his ground against the barbarians who gave pursuit,
and after a severe conflict slew some and took others
prisoners. On the king’s side, however, not a few received
wounds which all but proved fatal, since the barbarians
had anointed their steels with a deadly tincture, and had
taken the field to bring the war to an issue in full reliance
on its efficacy. This virulent tincture was prepared from
snakes of a certain kind which were hunted by the natives,
who on killing them exposed their carcases to the sun in
order that the flesh might be decomposed by the burning
heat of his rays. As this process went on the juices fell
out in drops, and by this liquid the poison was secreted
from the carcases of the snakes. Accordingly, when any
one was wounded, his body at once became numb, and
sharp pains soon succeeded, while the whole frame was
shaken with tremblings and convulsions. The skin
became cold and livid, and the stomach discharged bile.
A foam, moreover, of a black colour issued from the
wound and putrefied. At this stage the poison quickly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
spread to the vital parts of the body, and caused a death
of fearful agony. Those, therefore, who had been severely
wounded and those who had received nothing more than
an accidental scratch suffered equally. While the
wounded were perishing by such a horrible death, the
king was not so much grieved for the others, but was in
the deepest distress of mind on account of Ptolemy, who
afterwards became a king, and for whom he had at that
time a warm affection. Now at this crisis an incident
occurred of a strange and marvellous nature, which concerned
Ptolemy, and which some ascribed to the provident
care of the gods for his safety. For as he was loved by
all the soldiers for his bravery and his unbounded
generosity, so in his hour of need he obtained the kindly
help he required. For the king in his sleep saw a vision
in which he appeared to see a serpent holding a plant in
its mouth, and showing its nature and its powers, and the
place where it grew. Then Alexander, when he awoke,
had search made for the plant and discovered it. This
he ground into a powder, which he not only laid as a
plaster on Ptolemy’s body, but also administered to him
as a potion, and by this means restored him to health.
When the valuable properties of the plant became known,
the other patients to whom the remedy was applied recovered
in like manner.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> He then laid siege to the
capital of the Harmatêlioi, a city both of great size and
strength. As the inhabitants, however, came to meet
him with the symbols of suppliants, and tendered their
submission, he dismissed them without enacting any
retributive penalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter CIV.—Alexander sails down to the mouth of the
Indus—Sails back to Tauala (Patala?)—Starts on
his march homewards, instructing Nearchos to explore
the way with his fleet to the head of the Persian Gulf—Ravages
the land of the Oritians and founds another
Alexandreia</i></h5>

<p>He then sailed down the stream with his friends to
the ocean, and when he had there seen two islands he
forthwith offered a sacrifice of great splendour to the gods,
casting at the same time many large drinking-cups of
gold, along with the libations they held, into the bosom
of the deep. Having next erected altars to Têthys and
Okeanos, he assumed that he had finished the expedition
which he had undertaken. He then started on the return
voyage, and in sailing up the river came to Tauala,<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> a city
of great note, with a political constitution drawn on the
same lines as the Spartan; for in this community the
command in war was vested in two hereditary kings of
two different houses, while a council of elders ruled the
whole state with paramount authority. Alexander now
burned all the vessels that were worn out, and gave the
command of the rest that were still serviceable to
Nearchos and some others of his friends, whom he
instructed to coast along the shores of the ocean, and
after having carefully explored whatever lay on their
route, to rejoin him at the mouth of the river Euphrates.
He himself with his army traversed a great extent of
country, overcoming those who opposed him, and treating
humanely those who offered their submission. He thus
gained over without any danger being incurred the people
called the Arbitai and the inhabitants of Kedrôsia. Then,
after passing through an extensive waterless tract, of
which no inconsiderable part was desert, he reached the
borders of Oritis. Here he divided his army into three
parts, giving Ptolemy the command of the first division,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
and Leonnatos of the second, Ptolemy being commissioned
to ravage and plunder the seaboard, and Leonnatos
the interior, while the third division, under his own
command, devastated the plains towards the hills and the
hill country itself. While the fury of war was thus at one
and the same time let loose over the whole land, conflagration,
pillage, and massacre ran riot in every special
locality. The soldiers accordingly soon appropriated a
vast amount of booty, while the number of the inhabitants
cut off by the sword amounted to many myriads. All
the neighbours of these unfortunate tribes, appalled by the
destruction which had overtaken them, submitted to the
king. But Alexander, who was ambitious to found a city
by the seaside, discovered a harbour sheltered from the
violence of the waves, and which had a convenient site
near it, and he built thereon the city of Alexandreia.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter CV.—How the Oritians bury their dead—The
Ichthyophagoi described—Sufferings and losses of the
army in the Gedrôsian desert—Relief sent by various
satraps—Leonnatos is attacked by the Oritians</i></h5>

<p>Alexander having stolen into the country of the Oritai
by the passes, quickly reduced the whole of it to submission.
The Oritai, while in other respects closely
resembling the Indians, have one custom which is different,
and altogether staggers belief. It has reference to their
treatment of the dead. For when a man dies his relatives,
naked and holding spears, carry away his body to the
oak-coppices which grow in their country, and having
there deposited it, and stripped it of the apparel and
ornaments with which it is arrayed, they leave it to
be devoured by wild beasts. When they have divided
the garments which were worn by the deceased, they
sacrifice to the heroes now in the under world, and give
an entertainment to the members of his household.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>Alexander next advanced towards Kedrôsia, following
the route along the sea-coast. He encountered on the
way an inhospitable and utterly savage tribe, for there
the natives let their nails grow without ever cutting them
from the day they are born to old age, allow their growth
of hair to become matted, have complexions scorched with
the heat of the sun, and are dressed with the skins of wild
beasts. They subsist on the flesh of whales stranded on
their shores. Their habitations they prepare by running
up walls, and forming the roofs of the ribs of the whale,
these supplying beams of a length of 18 cubits. For
covering over the roofs they use instead of tiles the scales
of fish.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Alexander, in passing through the country of
these savages, was much distressed by the scarcity of
provisions; but in the next country he entered he fared
still worse, for it was desert and bare of everything useful
to support life. As many perished from sheer want,
the stout hearts of the Macedonians yielded to despondency,
and Alexander was overwhelmed with no ordinary
grief and anxiety; for it seemed a terrible thing that his
men, who surpassed all mankind in bravery and in arms,
should perish ingloriously in a desert land and in utter
destitution. He therefore despatched messengers post-haste
into Parthyaia,<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> and Drangianê,<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> and Areia,<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> and the
other states bordering on the desert, enjoining them to
send quickly to the passes of Karmania dromedaries and
other beasts of burden laden with food and other necessaries.
These messengers having rapidly performed the
journey to the satraps of these provinces, caused ample
supplies of provisions to be conveyed to the appointed
place. Alexander had, however, before their arrival lost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
many of his soldiers from his inability to relieve their
wants; and afterwards, when he was on the march, some
of the Oritai, having attacked the troops commanded by
Leonnatos and slain a good many men, escaped scatheless
into their own country.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter CVI.—Revels of Alexander and the army after

<p>When the desert had been crossed with all these painful
experiences, he came to an inhabited region which
abounded with all things useful. He here allowed his
army to recruit its exhausted powers, and then marched
forward for seven days with his soldiers splendidly dressed
as at a public assembly, while he celebrated a festival to
Dionysos, heading himself the procession of the revellers,
and, as he led the way, quaffing intoxicating draughts of
wine. At the end of all this having come to learn that
many high-placed officials had transgressed all bounds
of law by an arbitrary and outrageous exercise of their
authority, he decided that not a few of his satraps and
generals stood in need of punishment. As the odium in
which these leading men were held on account of their
scandalous disregard of the law was a matter of public
notoriety, many of them who held high posts of command
in the army, and whose conscience accused them of outrages
and other violations of their duty, became seriously
alarmed. Some whose troops consisted of mercenaries
revolted from the king, and others who had amassed
riches took to flight. The king on hearing this wrote to
all the commanders and satraps throughout Asia that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
immediately after they had read his letter they should
dismiss all the mercenaries.</p>

<p>When the king was just at this time staying in a
sea-coast town called Salmous, and holding a dramatic
exhibition, the officers of the expedition which had been
directed to navigate the ocean along its shores put into
harbour, and, proceeding straightway to the theatre, saluted
Alexander, and gave him an account of their adventures.
The Macedonians, delighted to see their old comrades
once more among them, marked the event with loud and
prolonged cheering, and all the theatre was in a transport
of joy that could not be exceeded.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> The voyagers described
how the ocean was subject to the strange vicissitude
of the ebbing and flowing of its waters, and that when it
ebbed numerous islands were unexpectedly revealed to
view at the projections of land along the coast, while at
flood-tide all these lands just mentioned were again submerged,
a full gale blowing meanwhile towards shore, and
whitening with foam all the surface of the water. But the
strangest part of their story was that they had encountered
a great many whales, and these of an incredible size.
They were in great dread of these monsters, and at first
gave up all hopes of life, thinking they might at any
moment be consigned, boats and all, to destruction; but
when, on recovering from their panic, they raised a simultaneous
shout, which they increased by rattling their arms
and sounding the trumpets, the creatures took alarm at
the strange noise, and sank to the depths below.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter CVII.—Kalanos, the Indian philosopher, immolates
himself—Alexander marries the daughter of Darius</i></h5>

<p>When the king had heard their story to the end, he
ordered the leaders of the expedition to sail up to the
mouth of the Euphrates. At the head of his army he
traversed himself a great stretch of country, and arrived
on the borders of Sousiana. About that time Kalanos,
the Indian who had made great progress in philosophy,
and was held in honour and esteem by Alexander, brought
his life to an end in a most singular manner; for when
he was three years over three score and ten, and up till
then had never known what illness was, he resolved to
depart this life as one who had received the full measure
of happiness alike from nature and from fortune. He was
now, however, afflicted with a malady which became daily
more and more burdensome, and he therefore requested
the king to prepare for him a great funeral pyre, and to
order his servants to set fire to it as soon as he should
ascend it. Alexander at first tried to divert him from his
purpose, but when he found that all his remonstrances
were unavailing, he consented to do him the service asked.
Orders were accordingly given for doing the work, and
when the pyre was ready the whole army attended to
witness the extraordinary spectacle. Then Kalanos, following
the rules prescribed by his philosophy, stepped
with unflinching courage on to the summit of the pyre,
and perished in the flames which consumed it. Some of
the spectators condemned the man for his madness, others
for the vanity shown in his act of hardihood, while some
admired his high spirit and contempt of death. The king
honoured him with a sumptuous funeral, and then proceeded
to Sousa, where he married Stateira, the elder of
the two daughters of Darius.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter LVIII.—Alexander at Nysa</i></h5>

<p>... When the Macedonians were hesitating to attack
the city called Nysa, because the river which ran past it was
deep, “Unlucky man that I am,” Alexander exclaimed,
“why did I not learn to swim?” and so saying he prepared
to ford the stream. After he had withdrawn from
the assault, envoys arrived from the besieged with an offer
to surrender. They were at first surprised to find him clad
in his armour, and still stained with the dust and blood of
battle. A cushion was then brought to him, which he
requested the eldest of the envoys to take and be seated.
This man was called Akouphis, and he was so much struck
with the splendour and courtesy with which he was received
that he asked what his countrymen must do to
make him their friend. Alexander replied: “They must
make you their governor, and send me a hundred of their
best men.” At this Akouphis laughed, and said: “Methinks,
O King! I should rule better if, instead of the
best, you took the worst.”</p>

<h5><i>Chapter LIX.—Interchange of civilities between Alexander
and Taxilês—Alexander breaks his faith with Indian
mercenaries, and hangs some Indian philosophers</i></h5>

<p>Taxilês, it is said, ruled over a part of India which was
as large as Egypt, afforded good pasturage, and had a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
very fertile soil. He was a shrewd man, and after he
had embraced Alexander, said to him: “Why should we
two, Alexander, fight with one another if you have come
to take away from us neither our water nor our necessary
food—the only things about which sensible men ever care
to quarrel and fight. As for anything else, call it money
or call it property, if I am richer than you, what I have
is at your service; but if I have less than you, I would
not object to stand debtor to your bounty.” Alexander
was delighted with what he said, and, giving him his right
hand in token of his friendship, exclaimed: “Perhaps you
think from the friendly greetings we have exchanged our
intercourse will be continued without a contest. There
you are mistaken, for I will war to the knife with you in
good offices, and will see to it that you do not overcome
me in generosity.” Alexander therefore, after having
received many presents from Taxilês, and given him more
in return, at last drank to his health, and accompanied
the toast with the present of a thousand talents of coined
money. This act of his greatly vexed his friends, but
made him stand higher in favour with many of the barbarians.
As the Indian mercenary troops, consisting, as
they did, of the best soldiers to be found in the country,
flocked to the cities which he attacked, and defended
them with the greatest vigour, he thus incurred serious
losses, and accordingly concluded a treaty of peace with
them; but afterwards, as they were going away, set upon
them while they were on the road, and killed them all.
This rests as a foul blot on his martial fame, for on all
other occasions he observed the rules of civilised warfare
as became a king.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> The philosophers gave him no less
trouble than the mercenaries, because they reviled the
princes who declared for him and encouraged the free
states to revolt from his authority. On this account he
hanged many of them.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter LX.—The account of the battle with Pôros, as
given by Alexander himself—Alexander’s noble treatment
of Pôros</i></h5>

<p>How the war against Pôros was conducted he has
described in his own letters. He tells us that the river
Hydaspês ran between the two camps, and that Pôros
with his elephants which he had posted with their heads
towards the stream, constantly guarded the passage.
Alexander himself, day after day, caused a great noise
and disturbance to be made in his camp, in order that
the barbarians might be gradually led to view his movements
without alarm. At last, upon a dark and stormy
night, he took a part of the infantry and a choice body of
cavalry, marched to a considerable distance from the enemy,
and crossed over to an island of no great size. Here he
was exposed with his army to the rage of a violent
thunderstorm, amid which rain fell down in torrents, and
though he saw some of his men struck dead with the
lightning, he nevertheless advanced from the island and
reached the furthermost bank of the river. The Hydaspês
was now flooded by the rains, and its raging current
had chosen a new channel of great width, down which
a great body of water was carried. In fording this new
bed, he could with difficulty keep his footing, as the
bottom was very slippery and uneven. It was here that
Alexander is said to have exclaimed, “O Athenians! can
you believe what dangers I undergo to earn your
applause?” This particular rests on the authority of
Onesikritos, for Alexander himself merely says that he
and his men left their rafts, and under arms waded
through the second torrent with the water up to their
breasts. After crossing, he himself rode forward about
twenty stadia in advance of the infantry, concluding that if
the enemy attacked him with their cavalry only, he could
easily rout them; but if they moved forward their entire
force, he could bring his infantry into the field before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
fighting began. He was right in both conclusions, for
he fell in with 1000 horse and 60 war-chariots of the
enemy, and these he routed, capturing every chariot,
and slaying 400 of the horsemen. Pôros thus perceived
that Alexander himself had crossed the river, and he
therefore advanced against him with all his army, except
some troops which he left to guard his camp, in case the
Macedonians should cross from the opposite bank to
attack it. Alexander, dreading the elephants and the
great numbers of the enemy, did not engage with them in
front, but attacked them himself on the left wing, ordering
Koinos to fall upon them on the right. Both wings
were broken, and the enemy, driven from their position,
thronged always towards the centre where the elephants
were posted. The contest, which began early in the
morning, was so obstinately maintained that it was fully
the eighth hour of the day before the Indians renounced
all attempts at further resistance. This description of the
battle is given by the chief actor in it himself in his
letters. Most historians are agreed that Pôros stood four
cubits and a span high, and that his gigantic form was
not less proportioned to the elephant which carried him,
and which was his biggest, than was a rider of an
ordinary size to his horse. This elephant showed
wonderful sagacity and care for its royal master, for while
it was still vigorous it defended him against his assailants
and repulsed them, but when it perceived that he was
ready to sink from the number of his wounds and bruises,
fearing that he might fall off its back, it gently lowered
itself to the ground, and as it knelt quietly extracted the
darts from his body with its trunk. When Pôros was
taken prisoner, Alexander asked him how he wished to
be treated. “Like a king,” answered Pôros. When
Alexander further asked if he had anything else to
request, “Every thing,” rejoined Pôros, “is comprised in
the words, like a king.” Alexander then not only
reinstated Pôros in his kingdom with the title of satrap,
but added a large province to it, subduing the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
whose form of government was the republican. This
country, it is said, contained 15 tribes, 5000 considerable
cities, and villages without number.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> He subdued
besides another district three times as large, over which
he appointed Philippos, one of his friends, to be satrap.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXI.—Death of Boukephalas, and Alexander’s
regret at his loss</i></h5>

<p>After the battle with Pôros, Boukephalas died, not
immediately, but some time afterwards, from wounds which
he received in the engagement. This is the account
which most historians give, but Onesikritos says that he
died of old age and overwork, for he had reached his
thirtieth year.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Alexander deeply regretted his loss,
taking it as much to heart as if it had been that of a
faithful friend and companion. He founded a city in his
honour on the banks of the Hydaspês, and named it
Boukephalia. It is also recorded that when he lost a pet
dog called Peritas, which he had brought up, and of which
he was very fond, he founded a city and called it by the
name of this dog. Sôtiôn tells us that he had heard this
from Potamôn of Lesbos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXII.—The army refuses to advance to the Ganges—Alexander,
preparing to retreat, erects altars which
were afterwards held in veneration by the Praisian
kings—The opinion of Androkottos</i></h5>

<p>The battle with Pôros depressed the spirits of the
Macedonians, and made them very unwilling to advance
farther into India. For as it was with the utmost difficulty
they had beaten him when the army he led amounted
only to 20,000 infantry and 2000 cavalry, they now
most resolutely opposed Alexander when he insisted that
they should cross the Ganges.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> This river, they heard,
had a breadth of two-and-thirty stadia, and a depth of
100 fathoms, while its farther banks were covered all
over with armed men, horses, and elephants. For the
kings of the Gandaritai and the Praisiai<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> were reported
to be waiting for him with an army of 80,000 horse,
200,000 foot, 8000 war chariots, and 6000 fighting
elephants. Nor was this any exaggeration, for not
long afterwards Androkottos,<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> who had by that time
mounted the throne, presented Seleukos with 500
elephants, and overran and subdued the whole of India
with an army of 600,000 men. Alexander at first in
vexation and rage withdrew to his tent, and shutting
himself up lay there feeling no gratitude towards those
who had thwarted his purpose of crossing the Ganges;
but regarding a retreat as tantamount to a confession of
defeat. But being swayed by the persuasions of his
friends, and the entreaties of his soldiers who stood weeping
and lamenting at the door of his tent, he at last
relented, and prepared to retreat. He first, however, contrived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
many unfair devices to exalt his fame among the
natives, as, for instance, causing arms for men and stalls
and bridles for horses to be made much beyond the usual
size, and these he left scattered about. He also erected
altars for the gods which the kings of the Praisiai even to the
present day hold in veneration, crossing the river to offer
sacrifices upon them in the Hellenic fashion.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Androkottos
himself, who was then but a youth, saw Alexander himself,
and afterwards used to declare that Alexander could
easily have taken possession of the whole country since
the king was hated and despised by his subjects for the
wickedness of his disposition and the meanness of his
origin.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXIII.—Alexander starts on a voyage down stream,
reducing tribes by the way—He is dangerously
wounded in the capital of the Malloi—Extraction of
the arrow from his wound—His recovery</i></h5>

<p>After marching thence Alexander, who wished to see
the outer ocean, ordered many rafts and vessels managed
with oars to be built, and he then fell down the rivers in
a leisurely manner. But the voyage was neither an idle
one nor unattended with warlike operations, for at times
he disembarked, and attacking the cities which adjoined
the banks succeeded in subduing them all. But he very
nearly lost his life when he was amongst the people called
the Malloi, who were said to be the most warlike of all
the Indians. For in besieging their city, after he had
driven the defenders from the walls by volleys of missiles,
he was the first man to ascend a scaling ladder and reach
the summit of the wall.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Just then the ladder broke, so
that he was left almost alone, and as the barbarians who
were standing at the foot of the wall inside shot at him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
from below, he was repeatedly hit with their missiles. He
therefore poised himself and leaped down into the midst
of his enemies, alighting by good chance on his feet. The
flashing of his arms as he brandished them made the
barbarians think that lightning or some supernatural
splendour played round his person, and they therefore
drew back and dispersed. But when they saw that he
was attended by two followers only, some of them
attacked him at close-quarters with swords and spears,
while one man, who stood a little farther off, shot an
arrow from his bow at full bent, and with such force that
it pierced through his corselet and lodged itself in the
bones of his breast.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> As he staggered under the blow
and sank upon his knees, the barbarian ran up with his
drawn scimitar to despatch him. Peukestas and Limnaios<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
placed themselves before Alexander to protect him; both
of them were wounded, one of them mortally; but
Peukestas, who survived, continued to make some resistance,
while the king slew the Indian with his own hand.
Alexander was wounded in many places; and at last
received a blow on his neck from a club, which forced
him to lean for support against the wall with his face
turned towards the enemy. The Macedonians, who by
this time had come up, crowded round him, and snatching
him up, now insensible to all around him, carried him off
to his tent. A rumour immediately ran through the
camp that he was dead, and his attendants having with
great difficulty sawed through the arrow, which had a
wooden shaft, were thus able after much trouble to take
off his corselet. They had next to extract the barbed
head of the arrow which was firmly fixed in one of his
ribs. This arrow-head is said to have measured three
fingers’ breadths in width and four in length. Accordingly,
when it was pulled out, he swooned away and was
brought very near the gates of death, but he at length<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
revived. When he was out of danger, but still very
weak, having for a long time to follow the mode of life
most conducive to the restoration of his health, he heard
a disturbance outside his tent, and learning that the
Macedonians were longing to see him he put on his cloak
and went out to them. After sacrificing to the gods, he
again moved forward and subdued a great extent of
country and many considerable cities that lay on his
route.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXIV.—Alexander’s interview with the
Indian gymnosophists</i></h5>

<p>He captured ten of the gymnosophists who had been
principally concerned in persuading Sabbas<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> to revolt,
and had done much harm otherwise to the Macedonians.
These men are thought to be great adepts in the art of
returning brief and pithy answers, and Alexander proposed
for their solution some hard questions, declaring that he
would put to death first the one who did not answer
correctly and then the others in order.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>He demanded of the first “Which he took to be the
more numerous, the living or the dead?” He answered,
“The living, for the dead are not.”</p>

<p>The second was asked, “Which breeds the largest
animals, the sea or the land?” He answered, “The land,
for the sea is only a part of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>The third was asked, “Which is the cleverest of
beasts?” He answered, “That with which man is not
yet acquainted.”</p>

<p>The fourth was asked, “For what reason he induced
Sabbas to revolt?” He answered, “Because I wished
him to live with honour or die with honour.”</p>

<p>The fifth was asked, “Which he thought existed first,
the day or the night?” He answered, “The day was
first by one day.” As the king appeared surprised at
this solution, he added, “Impossible questions require
impossible answers.”</p>

<p>Alexander then turning to the sixth asked him “How
a man could best make himself beloved?” He answered,
“If a man being possessed of great power did not make
himself to be feared.”</p>

<p>Of the remaining three, one being asked “How a man
could become a god?” replied, “By doing that which is
impossible for a man to do.”</p>

<p>The next being asked, “Which of the two was stronger,
life or death?” he replied, “Life, because it bears so
many evils.”</p>

<p>The last being asked, “How long it was honourable
for a man to live?” answered, “As long as he does not
think it better to die than to live.”</p>

<p>Upon this Alexander, turning to the judge, requested
him to give his decision. He said they had answered
each one worse than the other. “Since such is your
judgment,” Alexander then said, “you shall be yourself
the first to be put to death.” “Not so,” said he,
“O king, unless you are false to your word, for you said
that he who gave the worst answer should be the first
to die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXV.—Onesikritos confers with the Indian gymnosophists
Kalanos and Dandamis—Kalanos visits
Alexander and shows him a symbol of his empire</i></h5>

<p>The king then gave them presents and dismissed them
to their homes. He also sent Onesikritos to the most
renowned of these sages, who lived by themselves in
tranquil seclusion, to request that they would come to
him.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> This Onesikritos was a philosopher who belonged
to the school of Diogenês the Cynic. He tells us that
one of these men called Kalanos ordered him with the
most overbearing insolence and rudeness to take off his
clothes, and listen naked to his discourse—otherwise he
would not enter into conversation with him even if he
came from Zeus himself. Dandamis, however, was of a
milder temper, and when he had been told about Sôkrates,
Pythagoras and Diogenês, he said they appeared to him
to have been men of genius, but from an excessive deference
to the laws had subjected their lives too much to
their requirements. But other writers tell us that he said
nothing more than this, “For what purpose has Alexander
come all the way hither?” Taxilês, however, persuaded
Kalanos to visit Alexander. His real name was Sphinês,
but as he saluted those whom he met with “Kale,” which
is the Indian equivalent of “Chairein” (that is, “All
hail”), he was called by the Greeks Kalanos. This
philosopher, we are told, showed Alexander a symbol of
his empire. He threw down on the ground a dry and
shrivelled hide and planted his foot on the edge of it.
But when it was trodden down in one place, it started up
everywhere else. He then walked all round it and showed
that the same thing took place wherever he trod, until at
length he stepped into the middle, and by doing so made
it all lie flat. This symbol was intended to show
Alexander that he should control his empire from its
centre, and not wander away to its distant extremities.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXVI.—Alexander visits the island Skilloustis,
and sailing thence explores the sea—Sufferings of his
army on the march homeward, and extent of its losses—Relief
sent by the satraps</i></h5>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.—Greek Warship.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Alexander’s voyage down the rivers to the sea occupied
seven months. On reaching the ocean he sailed to
an island which he himself has called Skilloustis, but
which is generally known as Psiltoukis.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> On landing
there he sacrificed to the gods, exploring afterwards the
nature of the sea and the coast as far as he could
penetrate. This done, he turned back, after praying to
the gods that no man might ever overpass the limits
which his expedition had reached. He ordered his fleet
to sail along the coast, keeping India
on the right hand; and he appointed
Nearchos to the chief command, with
Onesikritos as the master pilot. He
himself, returning by land with the
army, marched through the country
of the Oreitai, where he was reduced
to the sorest straits from the scarcity
of provisions, and lost such numbers
of men that he hardly brought
back from India the fourth part of his military force, though
he entered it with 120,000 foot and 15,000 horse. Many
perished from malignant distempers, wretched food, and
scorching heat, but most from sheer hunger, for their
march lay through an uncultivated region, inhabited only
by some miserable savages, the owners of a small and
inferior breed of sheep, accustomed to feed on sea-fish,
which gave to their flesh a rank and disagreeable flavour.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
With great difficulty, therefore, he traversed this desert
region in sixty days, and reached Gedrôsia, where all the
men were at once supplied with abundance of provisions,
furnished by the satraps and kings of the nearest
provinces.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter LXVII.—Alexander and the army indulge in wild
revelry on emerging from the desert</i></h5>

<p>After he had given his forces some time to recruit, he
led them in a joyous revel for seven days through Karmania.
He himself sat at table with his companions
mounted on a lofty oblong platform drawn by eight
horses, and in that conspicuous position feasted continually
both by day and by night. This carriage was followed
by numberless others, some with purple hangings and
embroidered canopies, and others screened with over-arching
green boughs always fresh gathered, conveying
the rest of Alexander’s friends and officers crowned with
garlands and drinking wine. There was not a helmet, a
shield, or a pike to be seen, but all along the road the
soldiers were dipping cups, horns, and earthen vessels
into great jars and flagons of wine, and drinking one
another’s healths, some as they went marching forward,
and others as they sat by the way. Wherever they
passed might be heard the music of the pipe and the
flute and the voices of women singing and dancing and
making merry. During this disorderly and dissolute
march the soldiers after their cups indulged in ribald
jests, as if the god Dionysos himself were present among
them and accompanying their joyous procession.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Alexander,
on reaching the capital of Gedrôsia, again halted
to refresh his army, and entertained it with feasting and
revelry.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter VII.—Alexander visits Nysa and Mount Merus—Receives
the submission of Queen Cleophis and
captures the Rock (Aornos)</i></h5>

<p>... After this he advanced towards India that he
might make the ocean and the remotest East the limits
of his empire. In order that the decorations of his army
might be in keeping with this grandeur, he overlaid the
trappings of the horses and the arms of his soldiers with
silver. He then called the army his argyraspids, because
the shields they carried were inwrought with silver.
When he had reached the city of Nysa, and found that
the inhabitants offered no resistance, he ordered their
lives to be spared, from a sentiment of reverence towards
Father Bacchus, by whom the city had been founded; at
the same time congratulating himself that he had not
only undertaken a military expedition like that god, but
had even followed his very footsteps. He then led his
army to view the sacred mountain, which the genial
climate had mantled over with vine and ivy, just as if
husbandmen had with industrious hands laboured to make
it the perfection of beauty. Now the army on reaching
the mountain, in a sudden access of devout emotion,
began to howl in honour of the god, and to the amazement
of the king ran unmolested all about the place, so
that he perceived that by sparing the citizens he had not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
so much served their interests as those of his own army.
Thence he marched to the Daedali mountains<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> and the
dominions of Queen Cleophis,<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> who, after surrendering her
kingdom, purchased its restoration by permitting the
conqueror to share her bed, thus gaining by her fascinations
what she had not gained by her valour. The offspring
of this intercourse was a son, whom she called
Alexander, the same who afterwards reigned as an Indian
king. Queen Cleophis, because she had prostituted her
chastity, was thereafter called by the Indians <i>the royal
harlot</i>. When Alexander after traversing India had
come to a rock of a wonderful size and ruggedness, unto
which many of the people had fled for refuge,<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> he came
to know that Hercules had been prevented from capturing
that very rock by an earthquake. Being seized,
therefore, with an ambitious desire of surpassing the
deeds of Hercules, he made himself master of the rock
with infinite toil and danger, and then received the submission
of all the tribes in that part of the country.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter VIII.—Alexander conquers Porus—Builds Nicaea
and Boucephala, and reduces the Adrestae, Gesteani,
Praesidae, and Gangaridae—Advances to the Cuphites
(Beäs), beyond which the army refuses to follow him—He
agrees to return, and leaves memorials of his
progress</i></h5>

<p>One of the Indian kings called Porus, a man remarkable
alike for his personal strength and noble courage, on
hearing the report about Alexander, began to prepare
war against his coming. Accordingly, when hostilities
broke out, he ordered his army to attack the Macedonians,
from whom he demanded their king, as if he was his
private enemy. Alexander lost no time in joining battle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
but his horse being wounded at the first charge, he fell
headlong to the ground, and was saved by his attendants
who hastened up to his assistance. Porus again, when
fainting from the number of his wounds, was taken
prisoner. His defeat he took so much to heart that
when he had received quarter from the victor, he neither
wished to take food nor would allow his wounds to be
attended to, and indeed could scarcely be induced to
wish for life. Alexander, out of respect for his valour,
restored him in safety to his sovereignty. There he
built two cities, one which he called Nicaea, and the other
Boucephala, after the name of his horse. Moving thence
he conquered the Adrestae, the Gesteani, the Praesidae,
and the Gangaridae,<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> after defeating their armies with
great slaughter. When he reached the Cuphites,<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> where
the enemy awaited him with 200,000 cavalry, his soldiers,
worn out not less by the number of their victories than
by their incessant toils, all besought him with tears to
bring at last the war to a close—besought him to have
some remembrance of his native country and the duty of
returning to it—to have some consideration for the years
of his soldiers, to whom scarcely so much of life now
remained as would suffice them for returning home.
Some pointed to their hoary hair, others to their wounds,
others to their bodies withered with age or seamed with
scars. None, they said, except themselves had brooked
a continuous service under two kings, Philip and Alexander;
and now at last they entreated he would send
them home where their bodies, wasted as they were to
skeletons, might be buried in the tombs of their fathers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
seeing it was from no want of will they failed to second
his wishes, but from the incapacity of age. If, however,
he would not spare his soldiers, he should at all events
spare himself, and not wear out his good fortune by
subjecting it to too severe a strain. Alexander was
moved by these well-grounded entreaties, and, as if he
had now reached the goal of victory, ordered a camp to
be made of an unusual size and splendour, in order that
the work, while calculated to terrify the enemy by its
vastness, might be left to render himself an object of
admiration to future ages. Never did the soldiers apply
themselves with such alacrity to any work as they did to
this; and when it was finished they retraced their way to
the parts whence they had come as joyfully as if they
were returning from a field of victory.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter IX.—Alexander sailing down the Panjâb rivers to
the ocean, reduces the Hiacensanae, Silei, Ambri, and
Sigambri—He is dangerously wounded in attacking
one of their strongholds</i></h5>

<p>From thence Alexander proceeded to the river Acesines<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
and sailed down stream towards the ocean. On his way
he received the submission of the Hiacensanae<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> and the
Silei<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> whom Hercules had founded. Sailing onward, he
came to the Ambri and the Sigambri,<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> who opposed him
with an army of 80,000 foot and 60,000 cavalry. Having
defeated them, he led his army to their capital. On his
observing from the wall, which he was himself the first to
mount, that the city was left without defenders, he leaped
down without any attendant into the level space at the
foot of the wall. Then the enemy, noticing that he was
alone, rushed together with loud shouts from all quarters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
of the city to finish, if possible, the wars that embroiled
the world, by one man’s death, and give the many nations
he had attacked their revenge. Alexander made an
obstinate resistance, and single-handed fought against
thousands. It surpasses belief to tell how neither the
multitude of his assailants, nor the ceaseless storm of their
missiles, nor their savage yells made him quail, and how,
alone as he was, he slew and put thousands to flight.
When at last he saw that he was being overpowered by
numbers, he placed his back against the stem of a tree
which grew near the wall, and by this means protected
himself till, after he had for a long time stood at bay, his
danger became at length known to his friends, who forthwith
leaped down from the wall to his assistance. Of
these many were slain in the act of defending him, and
the issue of the conflict remained doubtful till the walls
were thrown down and the whole army came to his
rescue. In this battle Alexander was pierced by an arrow
under the pap, but even while he was fainting from the
loss of blood he sank on his knee, and continued fighting
till he slew the man by whom he had been wounded. The
operation required for curing his wound threw him into
a deadlier swoon than the wound itself had produced.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter X.—Alexander reaches the city of King Ambigerus
(Sambos?)—Ptolemy is there wounded by a poisoned
arrow—An antidote to the poison is revealed to
Alexander in a dream—He sails down to the mouth
of the Indus—Founds Barce—Leaves India and
returns to Babylon</i></h5>

<p>His safety was for a time despaired of, but having at
last recovered he sent Polyperchon with part of the army
to Babylon. Having himself embarked with a very select
company of his friends, he made a voyage along the
shores of the ocean. On his reaching the city of King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
Ambigerus<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> the inhabitants who had heard that he was invulnerable
by steel, armed their arrows with poison, which
thus inflicted a double wound. With this deadly weapon
they killed great numbers of the enemy and repulsed them
from the walls. Among many others that were wounded
was Ptolemy, but he was rescued from danger just when
he appeared to be dying, as soon as he had swallowed a
potion prepared from a particular herb which had been
revealed to the king in a vision as being an antidote to
the poison. The greater part of the army was saved by
the same remedy. Alexander having taken the city by
storm poured out a libation to the ocean, praying at the
same time for a prosperous return to his own country.
He was then carried down with the tide in his favour to
the mouth of the river Indus. And then like a victor who
had triumphantly driven his chariot round the goal, he
fixed the frontiers of his empire, having advanced till the
deserts at the world’s end barred his farther progress by
land, and till seas were no longer navigable. As a monument
of his achievements he founded in those parts the
city of Barce.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> He erected altars also, and on departing
left one of his friends to be governor of the maritime
Indians. As he intended to march homewards by land,
and had learned that his route would lie through arid
wastes, he ordered wells to be dug at convenient places.
Since these were found to yield a copious supply of water
he effected his return to Babylon.</p>

<h5><i>Chapter IV.—Seleucus Nicator subjugates the Bactrians
and enters India—The history of Sandrocottus who
was then King of India—Seleucus makes a treaty of
peace with him and returns to the West</i></h5>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;" id="figure14">
<img src="images/figure14.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.—Seleucus Nicator.</span></p>
</div>

<p>... Seleucus Nicator waged many wars in the east
after the partition of Alexander’s empire among his
generals. He first took Babylon, and then with his forces
augmented by victory subjugated the Bactrians. He then
passed over into India, which after Alexander’s death, as
if the yoke of servitude had been shaken off from its neck,
had put his prefects to death. Sandrocottus was the
leader who achieved their freedom, but after his victory
he forfeited by his tyranny all title
to the name of liberator, for he
oppressed with servitude the very
people whom he had emancipated
from foreign thraldom. He was born
in humble life, but was prompted to
aspire to royalty by an omen significant
of an august destiny. For when
by his insolent behaviour he had
offended Nandrus,<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and was ordered
by that king to be put to death, he sought safety by
a speedy flight. When he lay down overcome with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
fatigue and had fallen into a deep sleep, a lion of
enormous size approaching the slumberer licked with its
tongue the sweat which oozed profusely from his body,
and when he awoke, quietly took its departure. It was
this prodigy which first inspired him with the hope of
winning the throne, and so having collected a band of
robbers, he instigated the Indians to overthrow the existing
government. When he was thereafter preparing to
attack Alexander’s prefects, a wild elephant of monstrous
size approached him, and kneeling submissively like a
tame elephant received him on to its back and fought
vigorously in front of the army. Sandrocottus having
thus won the throne was reigning over India when
Seleucus was laying the foundations of his future greatness.
Seleucus having made a treaty with him and
otherwise settled his affairs in the east, returned home
to prosecute the war with Antigonus.</p>

<h4 id="NoteA"><span class="smcap">Note A.—Alexandreia under Kaukasos</span></h4>

<p>Alexander had founded this city at the foot of Paropanisos in
the spring of 329 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, before he crossed into Baktria. For
distinction’s sake it was called Alexandreia “under Kaukasos,”
or “of the Paropamisadai.” Its position has been a subject
much discussed. Sir A. Burnes and Lassen fixed it at Bamiân, but
to this there is the objection that Bamiân is situated in the midst
of the mountains, and is reached from Kâbul after the main
ridge of the Hindu-Kush has been crossed. A position which
would suit better for the foundation of a permanent settlement is
to be found in the rich and beautiful valley of the Koh-Dâman,
which, as its name implies, extends up to the very foot of the
great mountain rampart. Towards the northern edge of this
valley lies the village of Charikar, whence the three roads that
lead into Baktria diverge. In the neighbourhood of this commanding
position is a place called Opiân or Houpiân, where vast
ruins, first discovered by Masson, indicate the former presence of
an important town. A link to connect this place with Alexandreia
is supplied by Stephanos of Byzantium, who describes
Alexandreia as “a city in Opianê, near India.” From this we
may infer that Opiân or Houpiân was the capital of a country of
the same name, and that it formed the site of the city which
Alexander founded under Kaukasos. This view has been advocated
by Dr. H. Wilson and V. de Saint-Martin, and also by
General Cunningham, who supports it by a reference to the
famous itinerary preserved in Pliny (<i>N. H.</i> VI. xvii. 21), from
Diognêtos and Baitôn, who recorded the distances of Alexander’s
marches. Alexandreia, it is there stated, was 50 miles distant
from Ortospanum, and 237 from Peukolatis. As Ortospanum
has been on sufficient grounds identified with Kâbul, and Peukolatis
with Hashtnagar on the river Landaï, the question arises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
whether Houpiân is at the required distance from each of these
places, and General Cunningham shows that such is the case,
allowance being made for the rough methods employed in
calculating such distances in ancient times. Bunbury inclines
to accept this identification, but thinks that as Opianê is in
Stephanos the name of a country, the evidence of the modern
appellation (Houpiân) is of little weight in determining the
position of the city. No mention of this Alexandreia occurs
either in Ptolemy or the <i>Periplûs of the Erythraian Sea</i>, but it is
mentioned in the <i>Mahâvanso</i> under the form Alasaddâ, or
Alasandâ, as Hardy writes it. About the 7th century again
of our aera, the Chinese pilgrim Hiouen Thsiang speaks of
Houpiân (Hou-pi-na in Chinese transcription) as a large city in
which the chief of the Vardaks resided. Its ruin may be dated
from the aera of the Mohammedan conquest, for Baber in his
Memoirs speaks of Houpiân as if it were merely the name of the
Pass which opens on the valley of the Ghorbund. According to
Hardy, Alasandâ was the birthplace of Menander (the Milinda of
Sanskrit), the Graeco-Baktrian king. See Wilson’s <i>Ar. Antiq.</i>
pp. 179-182; V. de Saint-Martin, <i>Étude</i>, 21-26; Cunningham’s
<i>Anc. Geog. of India</i>, pp. 19-26; Bunbury’s <i>Hist. of Anc. Geog.</i>
i. 490-492; Weber’s <i>Die Griechen in Indien</i>; and Hardy’s <i>Manual
of Buddhism</i>, p. 516.</p>

<h4 id="NoteB"><span class="smcap">Note B.—Nikaia</span></h4>

<p>This is a Greek word meaning <i>victorious</i>, and may possibly
be a translation of the indigenous name of the place. Wilson
(<i>Ar. Antiq.</i> p. 183) takes this view, and fixes the site of Nikaia
on the plain of Begrâm at a spot with ruins about some eighteen
miles distant from Houpiân. The original name of the place
may have been <i>Jayapura</i>, which means <i>the city of victory</i>.
According to others, Nikaia is a transliteration of <i>Nichaia-gram</i>,
a place said to be in Kafîristân—that is, in the upper part of the
valleys which slope away from the Hindu-Kush and carry their
waters to the Kâbul river on its left. A belief was at one time
current that the Kafîrs of Bajour were descended from the
Macedonians whom Alexander had left there when he passed
through the country on his way to India. They had, it was said,
many points of character in common with the Greeks. They
were celebrated for their beauty and their European complexions.
They worshipped idols, drank wine in silver cups or vases, used
chairs and tables, and spoke a language unknown to their neighbours.
Elphinstone during his Kâbul mission (in 1808) caused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
inquiries to be made as to the truth of these reports, which had
greatly excited his curiosity. It was found that though they
were in the main correct, yet the fact that the people had no
certain traditions of their own as to their origin, while the
languages spoken by the different tribes were all of them closely
allied to Sanskrit, showed the theory of their Greek origin to be
untenable. In the list which was furnished to the envoy of the
names of their tribes and villages, Nisa is the only one in which
any similarity to Nikaia can be traced. In Lassen’s opinion,
Nikaia was not built on the site of any previously existing town,
but was first founded by Alexander, who named it the <i>victorious</i>
in anticipation of the triumphs which awaited him in India.
General Abbott identified it with Nangnihar, a place about four
or five miles west of Jalâlâbâd, which he thought Curtius took to
be the point where Alexander first entered Indian territory.
General Cunningham again, like Ritter and Droysen, thinks that
Nikaia must have been Kâbul, otherwise that important town,
through which Alexander must have marched, would be passed
over by his historians without mention. He cites in proof a
passage from the <i>Dionysiakê</i> of Nonnus, in which Nikaia is
described as a stone city situated near a lake. The lake, he
says, is a remarkable feature which is peculiar in Northern India
to Kâbul and Kâshmîr. The authority of Nonnus, however, on
such a point is of no worth whatever. Wilson’s view that Nikaia
occupied the site of Bagrâm seems preferable to any other. It
is the view also which Bunbury favours. (See his <i>History of
Ancient Geography</i>, p. 439 <i>n.</i>)</p>

<h4 id="NoteC"><span class="smcap">Note C.—Aspasioi Assakênoi</span></h4>

<p>The Aspasioi are the people called by Strabo, in his list of the
tribes which occupied the country between the Kôphês and the
Indus, the Hippasioi. They are easily to be recognised under
either of these names as the Aśvaka who are mentioned in the
<i>Mahâbhârata</i> along with the Gândhâra as the barbarous inhabitants
of far distant regions in the north. The name of the
<i>Aśvaka</i>, derived from <i>aśva</i>, “a horse,” means cavaliers, and
indicates that their country was renowned in primitive times, as
it is at the present day, for its superior breed of horses. The
fact that the Greeks translated their name into Hippasioi (from
ἵππος, a horse) shows that they must have been aware of its
etymological signification. V. de Saint-Martin inclines to think
that the name of the Hippasioi is partly preserved in that of the
Pachaï, a considerable tribe located in the upper regions of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
Kôphês basin. It is more distinctly preserved in <i>Asip</i> or <i>Isap</i>,
the Pukhto name of this tribe, called by Mohammedans the
<i>Yusufzai</i>. The name of the Assakênoi, like that of the Aspasioi,
represents the Sanskrit Aśvaka, which in the popular dialect is
changed into Assaka, and by the addition of the Persian plural
termination into Assakan, a form which Arrian has all but exactly
transcribed, and which appears without any change in the Assakanoi
of Strabo and the Assacani of Curtius. They are now
represented by the Aspîn of Chitral and the Yashkun of Gilgit.
Some writers think, however, that the name of the Assakans or
Asvakans is still extant in that of the Afghans, for the change of
the sibilant into the rough aspirate is quite normal, and also that
of <i>k</i> into <i>g</i>, a mute of its own order. Dr. Bellew, however, in his
<i>Inquiry into the Ethnography of Afghanistan</i>, finds the source of
the name in the Armenian Aghván, and says it seems clear from
what he has explained that the name Afghân merely means
“mountaineer,” and is neither an ethnic term of distinct race
nationality nor of earlier origin than the period of the Roman
dominion in Asia Minor. See the <i>Inquiry</i>, pp. 196-208.</p>

<h4 id="NoteD"><span class="smcap">Note D.—Mazaga</span></h4>

<p>The name of this place, which in Sanskrit would appear as
Mâśaka, has various forms in the classics—<i>Massaga</i> as in
our author here, <i>Massaka</i> in his <i>Indika</i>, <i>Mazaga</i> in Curtius,
and <i>Masoga</i> in Strabo, who says it was the capital of King
Assakanos. The exact position of this important place has not
yet been ascertained, but its name as that of an ancient site still
remains in the country. The Emperor Baber states in his
<i>Memoirs</i> that at the distance of two rapid marches from the town
of Bajore (the capital of the province of the same name), lying to
the west of the river Pañjkoré, there was a town called Mashanagar
on the river of Sévad (Swât). Rennell identified this name
with the Massaga of Alexander’s historians, and no doubt
correctly. M. Court, who has given interesting information
about the country of the Yuzafzaïs, which he collected among the
inhabitants of the plains, learned from them that at twenty-four
miles from Bajore there exists a ruined site known under the
double name of Maskhine and Massangar (Massanagar). In the
grammar again of Pânini, who was a native of Gândhâra, in
which the Assakan territory was comprised, the word Mâśakâvatî
occurs, given as the name both of a river and a district. It may
then fairly be presumed that Massaga was the capital of the
Mâśakâvatî district, and that the impetuous stream which, as we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
learn from Curtius, ran between steep banks and made access to
Massaga difficult on the east side, was the Mâśakâvatî of Pânini
(<i>v.</i> Lassen, <i>Ind. Alt.</i> II. pp. 136-138; V. de Saint-Martin, <i>Étude</i>,
pp. 35, 36; and Abbott, <i>Gradus ad Aornon</i>). Curtius (viii. 37, 38)
describes with more minuteness than Arrian the nature of the
engineering operations designed to make the attack against the
walls practicable. He states that Assacanus, the king of the
place, died before Alexander’s arrival, and not after the siege had
begun, as Arrian relates. He adds that Assacanus was succeeded
by his mother (wife?), whose name was Cleophis, and who,
according to Justin, bore a son whose paternity was ascribed to
Alexander. In reference to this statement Dr. Bellew remarks
that at the present day several of the chiefs and ruling families
in the neighbouring states of Chitral and Badakhshan boast a
lineal descent from Alexander the Great.</p>

<h4 id="NoteE"><span class="smcap">Note E.—Bazira</span></h4>

<p>Some writers have taken Bazira to be Bajore, which lies midway
between the river of Kunâr and the Landaï, but there is
nothing beyond the similarity of the two names to recommend
this view. As the Bazirians fled for refuge to the rock Aornos,
which overhung the Indus, it is evident they could not have
inhabited a place so remote from the rock as Bajore. Cunningham
finds a more likely position for Bazira at Bâzâr, “a large
village situated on the <i>Kalpan</i>, or Kâli-pâni river, and quite close
to the town of <i>Rustam</i>, which is built on a very extensive old
mound.... According to tradition this was the site of the
original town of Bâzâr. The position is an important one, as it
stands just midway between the Swât and the Indus rivers, and
has therefore been from time immemorial the <i>entrepôt</i> of trade
between the rich valley of Swât and the large towns on the Indus
and Kâbul rivers.... This identification is much strengthened
by the proximity of Mount <i>Dantalok</i>, which is most probably the

<h4 id="NoteF"><span class="smcap">Note F.—Aornos</span></h4>

<p>The identification of this celebrated rock has been one of the
most perplexing problems of Indian archaeology. The descriptions
given of it by the classical writers are more or less discrepant,
and their indications as to its position very vague and obscure.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
It has thus been identified with various positions, against each of
which objections of more or less weight may be urged, but the
view of General Abbott, who has identified it with Mount Mahâban,
has the balance of argument in its favour, and is now
generally adopted. The rock, to judge from Arrian’s description
of it, must have been in reality a mountain of very considerable
height, with a summit of tableland crowned here and there with
steep precipices. Curtius, on the other hand, says that the rock,
which was on all sides steep and rugged, did not rise to its
pinnacle in slopes of ordinary height and of easy ascent, but that
in shape it resembled the conical pillar of the racecourse, called
the <i>meta</i>, which springs from a broad basis and gradually tapers
till it terminates in a sharp point. Here Arrian, who drew his
facts from Ptolemy, a prominent actor in capturing Aornos, is, as
usual, a safer guide than Curtius, who wrote for effect, and often
dealt unscrupulously with the facts of history. Arrian, again, is
at variance with Diodôros in his estimate both of the circuit and
of the height of the rock, for while with him it has a circuit of
200 stadia (about 23 miles) and a height of 11, Diodôros
reduces the circuit by one-half and increases the height to 16
stadia. Curtius is silent on these points, but he mentions a
circumstance of great importance which Arrian has failed to note,
namely, that the roots of the rock were washed by the river
Indus. That he is right here cannot be questioned, for the
statement is corroborated both by Diodôros and by Strabo (xv.
687), while Arrian, who says nothing that can lead us to think
that his view was different, supplies us with a proof that Aornos
was close to the Indus, for he says of the city of Embolima, which
we now know to have been on the Indus, that it was situated close
to Aornos. The position thus indicated is about sixty miles
above Attak, where the Indus escapes into the plains from a long
and narrow mountain gorge which the ancients mistook for its
source. Colonel Abbott in 1854 explored this neighbourhood,
and came to the conclusion that Mount Mahâban, a hill which
abuts precipitously on the western bank of the Indus about eight
miles west from the site of Embolima, was Aornos. His arguments
in support of this identification are given in his <i>Gradus ad
Aornon</i>. His description of Mount Mahâban agrees in the main
with that which Arrian has given of Aornos. “The rock
Aornos,” he says, “was the most remarkable feature of the
country, as is the Mahâban. It was the refuge of all the neighbouring
tribes. It was covered with forests. It had good soil
sufficient for a thousand ploughs, and pure springs of water everywhere
abounded. It was 4125 feet above the plain, and 14<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
miles in circuit. It was precipitous on the side of Embolima, yet
not so steep but that 220 horse and the war-engines were taken
to the summit. The summit was a plain where cavalry could act.
It would be difficult to offer a more faithful description of the
mount.” “Why the historians,” he adds, “should all call it the
<i>rock</i> Aornos, it would be difficult to say. The side on which
Alexander scaled the main summit had certainly the character of
a rock, but the whole description of Arrian indicates a table
mountain.” Cunningham, in his <i>Ancient Geography of India</i>,
advances some arguments against this identification, but they
cannot be considered sufficiently cogent to warrant its rejection
unless a better could be substituted. That which he proposes,
however, is altogether untenable. What he suggests is that the
hill-fortress of Râni-gat, situated immediately above the small
village of Nogram, about sixteen miles north by west from Ohind,
which he takes to be the site of Embolima, corresponds in all
essential particulars, except in its elevation (under 1200 feet),
with the description of Aornos as given by Arrian, Strabo, and
Diodôros. Now if the elevation stated, which is some 6000 feet
under what Arrian assigns to Aornos, was really the height of the
rock, then the details of the operations by which it was captured
are rendered partly unintelligible. Thus, why should Ptolemy,
after ascending the rock to a certain distance, have kindled a fire
to let Alexander, who remained at the base, know where he was?
Can we not easily see with the naked eye from the foot to the
top of a small hill only ten or eleven hundred feet high? Moreover,
we are informed that it took Alexander from daybreak till
noon to reach the position occupied by Ptolemy. Can it be
supposed that all that space of time was required for the ascent
of a hill not much higher than Arthur’s Seat, near Edinburgh?
The highest mountain in Great Britain could be climbed in half
the time. Another equally fatal objection to this theory is the
distance of Râni-gat from the Indus. The roots of the rock were
indubitably washed by that river, but Râni-gat is no less than
sixteen miles distant from it. At the same time, if Râni-gat were
Aornos, then Ohind cannot be Embolima, for Arrian says that
Embolima was close to (ξύνεγγυς) Aornos. The identification of
the rock with Raja Hodi’s fort opposite Attak, first suggested by
General Court and afterwards supported by the learned missionary
Loewenthal, has in its favour the fact that the position is on the
Indus, but it is otherwise untenable. It is uncertain whether the
name Aornos is purely Greek or an attempt at the transliteration
of the indigenous name. If purely Greek, then Dionysios Perieg.
(l. 1150) is right in saying that men called the rock Aornis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
because even swift-winged birds had difficulty in flying over it.
If indigenous, the name may be referred to <i>Aranai</i>, which, as Dr.
Bellew states, is a common Hindi name for hill ridges in these
parts. He identifies the rock as <i>Shàh Dum</i> or <i>Malka</i>, on the
heights of Mahâban, the stronghold of the Wahabi fanatics, at the
destruction of which he was present in 1864. See his <i>Inquiry</i>,
p. 68.</p>

<h4 id="NoteG"><span class="smcap">Note G.—Nysa</span></h4>

<p>Arrian’s narrative indicates neither in what part of the Kôphên
and Indus Dôâb Nysa was situated, nor at what time Alexander
made his expedition to the place. But we learn from Curtius
(viii. 10), Strabo (xv. 697), and Justin (xii. 7) that he was there
before he had as yet crossed the Choaspes and taken Massaga,
and Arrian says nothing from which it can be inferred that his
opinion was different. Nysa was therefore most probably the
city which Ptolemy calls Nagara or Dionysopolis, and which has
been identified with Nanghenhar (the Nagarahâra of Sanskrit), an
ancient capital, the ruins of which have been traced at a distance
of four or five miles west from Jalâlâbâd. This place was called
also Udyânapura, <i>i.e.</i> “the city of gardens,” which the Greeks from
some resemblance in the sound translated into Dionysopolis, a
compound meaning “the city of Dionysos.” At some distance
eastward from this site, but on the opposite bank of the river,
there is a mountain called Mar-Koh (<i>i.e.</i> snake-hill) which, if
Nysa be Nagara, may be regarded as the Mount Meros which
lay near it, and was ascended by Alexander. It has, however,
been assumed that, in Arrian’s opinion, the expedition to Nysa
was not an early incident of the campaign in the Dôâb, but the
last of any importance after the capture of Aornos. The only
ground for this assumption is that his account of the expedition
to Nysa follows that of all the other transactions recorded to
have occurred west of the Indus. But the reason of this is not
far to seek. Arrian, on examining the accounts given by different
writers of the visit to Nysa and Meros, concluded that they were
for the most part apocryphal, and as he did not wish to mix up
romance with history, reserved the subject for separate treatment.
Abbott, who took it for granted that Arrian wished it to be
understood that Alexander visited Nysa after the capture of the
rock, looked for the site of that city nearer the Indus than the
plain of Jalâlâbâd; and found one to suit the requirements in the
neighbourhood of Mount Elum, called otherwise Râm Takht or
“the throne of Râm.” This remarkable mountain, he says, rises
like some mighty pagoda to the height of nine or ten thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
feet, and answers in many points to the descriptions given of
Meros, being densely covered with forests, full of wild beasts
and of a height at which, in that part of India, ivy, box, etc.,
flourish. At its roots are the following old towns with names all
derivable from Bacchos: Lusa (Nysa), Lyocah (Lyaeus), Elye,
Awân, Bimeeter (Bimêtêr), Bôkra (Bou-Kera), and Kerauna
(Keraunos). Beneath the town of Lusa flows the river Burindu,
which is occasionally unfordable during the spring. Abbott
makes this remark about the river with reference to the statement
in Plutarch that when Alexander sat down before Nysa, the
Macedonians had some difficulty of advancing to the attack on
account of the depth of the river that washed its walls. V. de
Saint-Martin and Dr. Bellew identify Nysa with Nysatta, a village
near the northern bank of the Kâbul river about six miles below
Hashtnagar, but except some correspondence between the names,
there seems little to recommend this view. Strabo has one or
two passages concerning Nysa. “In Sophoclês,” he says, “a
person is introduced speaking the praises of Nysa, as a mountain
sacred to Bacchos: ‘Whence I beheld the famed Nysa, the
resort of the Bacchanalian bands, which the horned Iacchos
makes his most pleasant and beloved retreat, where no bird’s
clang is heard.’ From such stories they gave the name Nysaians
to some imaginary nation, and called their city Nysa, founded by
Bacchos; a mountain above the city they called Mêros, alleging
as a reason for imposing these names that the ivy and vine grow
there, although the latter does not perfect its fruit, for the bunches
of grapes drop off before maturity in consequence of excessive
rains” (xv. 687). In a subsequent passage (697) he says: “After
the river Kôphês follows the Indus. The country lying between
these two rivers is occupied by the Astakênoi, Masianoi, Nysaioi,
and the Hippasioi. Next is the territory of Assakanos, where is
the city Masoga.” Pliny also has one or two notices of Nysa.
“Most writers,” he says (<i>H. N.</i> vi. 21), “assume that the city
Nysa and also the mountain Merus, consecrated to the god
Bacchus, belong to India. This is the mountain whence arose
the fable that Bacchus issued from the thigh (μηρός) of Jupiter.
They also assign to India the country of the Aspagani so plentiful
in vines, laurel, and box, and all kinds of fruitful trees that grow
in Greece.” In Book viii. 141, he says “that on Nysa, a
mountain in India, there are lizards 24 feet in length, and in
colour yellow or purple or blue.”</p>

<p>The legend that Dionysos was bred in the thigh of Zeus owes
its origin to a figurative mode of expression, common among the
Phoenicians and Hebrews, which was taken by the Greeks in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
literal sense. See the Epistle to the Hebrews, vii. 10. The
Kafîrs who now occupy the country through which Alexander
first marched on his way from the Kaukasos to the Indus, are
said by Elphinstone to drink wine to great excess, men and
women alike. “They dance,” he adds, “with great vehemence,
using many gesticulations, and beating the ground with great
force, to a music which is generally quick, but varied and wild.
Such usages would certainly have struck the Macedonians as
Bacchanalian.” So certainly would such a spectacle as the
following, described by Bishop Heber in his <i>Indian Journal</i>:
“The two brothers Rama and Luchman, in a splendid palkee,
were conducting the retreat of their army. The divine Hunimân,
as naked and almost as hairy as the animal he represented, was
gamboling before them, with a long tail tied round his waist, a
mask to represent the head of a baboon, and two great pointed
clubs in his hands. His army followed, a number of men with
similar tails and masks, their bodies dyed with indigo, and also
armed with clubs. I was never so forcibly struck with the
identity of Rama and Bacchus. Here were before me Bacchus,
his brother Ampelus, the Satyrs, smeared with wine-lees, and the
great Pan commanding them.” I may, in conclusion, subjoin a
notice of Bacchos in India from Polyainos: “Dionysos marching
against the Indians in order that the Indians might receive him
did not equip his troops with armour that could be seen, but
with soft raiment and fawn skins. The spears were wrapped
round with ivy, and the thyrsus had a sharp point. In making
signals he used cymbals and drums instead of the trumpet, and,
by warming the enemy with wine, he turned them (from war) to
dancing. These and all other Bacchic orgies were the stratagems
of war by which Bacchos subjugated the Indians and all the rest
of Asia. Dionysos, when in India, seeing that his army could
not endure the burning heat, seized the three-peaked mountain of
India. Of its peaks one is called Korasibiê, another Kondaskê,
but the third he himself named Mêros in commemoration of his
birth. Upon it were many fountains of water sweet of taste,
abundance of game and fruit, and snows, which gave new vigour
to the frame. The troops quartered there would take the barbarians
of the plains by surprise, and put them to an easy rout
by attacking them with missiles from their commanding position
on the heights above. Dionysos having conquered the Indians,
invaded Baktria, taking with him as auxiliaries the Indians themselves
and the Amazons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span></p>

<h4 id="NoteH"><span class="smcap">Note H.—Gold-digging Ants</span></h4>

<p>Herodotos was the first writer who communicated to the
Western nations the story of these ants. He relates it thus
(iii. 102): “There are other Indians bordering on the city of
Kaspatyros and the country of Paktyike (Afghânistân) settled
northward of the other Indians, who resemble the Baktrians in
the way they live. They are the most warlike of the Indians,
and are the men whom they send to procure the gold (paid in
tribute to the King of Persia), for their country adjoins the desert
of sand. In this desert then and in the sand there are ants, in
size not quite so big as dogs, but larger than foxes. Some that
were captured were taken thence, and are with the King of the
Persians. These ants, forming their dwelling underground, heap
up the sand as the ants in Greece do, and in the same manner;
and are very like them in shape. The sand which they cast up
is mixed with gold. The Indians therefore go to the desert to
get this sand, each man having three camels ... (c. 105).
When the Indians arrive at the spot they fill their sacks with the
sand, and return home with all possible speed. For the ants, as
the Persians say, having readily discovered them by the smell,
pursue them, and, as they are the swiftest of all animals, not one
of the Indians could escape except by getting the start while the
ants were assembling.”</p>

<p>Nearchos (quoted by Strabo, xv. 705) says that he saw skins
of the ants which dig up gold as large as the skins of leopards.
Megasthenes also (as quoted in the same passage) says that
among the Dardai, a populous nation of the Indians living
towards the east and among the mountains, there was a mountain
plain of about 3000 stadia in circumference, below which were
mines containing gold, which ants not less in size than foxes dig
up. In winter they dig holes and pile up the earth in heaps, like
moles, at the pit-mouths. Pliny (xi. 31) repeats the story in these
terms: “The horns of the Indian ant fixed up in the temple of
Hercules at Erythrae were objects of great wonderment. These
ants excavate gold from mines found in the country of those
Northern Indians who are called the Dardae. They are of the
colour of cats and of the size of Egyptian wolves. The Indians
steal the gold which they dig up in winter during the hot season
when the ants keep within their burrows to escape the stifling
sultriness of the weather. The ants, however, aroused by the
smell, sally out and frequently overtake and mangle the robbers,
though they have the swiftest of camels to aid their flight.” It is
now understood that the gold-digging ants were neither, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
ancients supposed, an extraordinary kind of real ants, nor, as
many learned men have since supposed, larger animals mistaken
for ants, but Tibetan miners who, like their descendants of the
present day, preferred working their mines in winter when the
frozen soil stands well and is not likely to trouble them by falling
in. The Sanskrit word pîpilika denotes both an <i>ant</i> and a
particular kind of <i>gold</i>.</p>

<p>The Dards consist now of several wild and predatory tribes
which are settled on the north-west frontier of Kashmir and by
the banks of the Indus. The gryphons who guarded the gold
were Tibetan mastiffs, a breed of unmatched ferocity. Gold is
still found in these regions.</p>

<h4 id="NoteI"><span class="smcap">Note I.—Taxila</span></h4>

<p>Pliny, in his <i>Natural History</i> (vi. 21), gives sixty miles as the
distance from Peukolatis (Hashtnagar) to Taxila. This would fix
its site somewhere on the Haro river to the west of Hasan Abdâl,
or just two days’ march from the Indus. But according to the
itineraries of the Chinese pilgrims, Fa-Hian and Hwen Thsiang,
Taxila lay at three days’ journey to the east of the Indus, and as
they made that journey, their authority on the point cannot be
questioned. Taxila, it may be therefore concluded, must have
been situated in the immediate neighbourhood of Kâla-ka-Sarâi.
Now at the distance of just one mile from this place, near the
rock-seated village of Shah-Dheri, Cunningham discovered the
ruins of a fortified city scattered over a wide space, extending
about three miles from north to south, and two miles from east
to west, and these ruins he took to be those of Taxila. They
lie about eight miles south-east of Hasan Abdâl, thirty-four miles
west from the famous tope of Manikyâla, and twenty-four miles
north-west from Rawal Pindi. The most ancient part of
these ruins, according to the belief of the natives, is a great
mound rising to a height of sixty-eight feet above the bed of
the stream, called the Tabrâ Nala, which flows past its east
side. Cunningham’s identification has now been accepted by
all archaeologists, and a Greek text hitherto neglected strikingly
confirms its correctness. This text is to be found in
the Pseudo-Kallisthenes, and I here translate the remarks made
upon it by Sylvain Lévi in a paper which he submitted last
year to the Société Asiatique, and which will be found printed
at pp. 236, 237 in the 15th volume of the 8th series of
the <i>Journal</i> of that society: “The Pseudo-Kallisthenes dwells
complacently on the sojourn of Alexander at Taxila and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
conversations with the Brahmans. The Brahmans (III. xii.
9, 10) blame the conduct of Kalanos, who, in violation of the
duties of his caste, went to live with the Macedonians. ‘It has
not pleased him,’ say they, ‘to drink the water of wisdom at the
river Tiberoboam.’ And further on (III. xiii. 12) they ask,
‘How could Alexander be the master of all the world when he
has not yet gone beyond the river Tiberoboam?’ The Latin of
Julius Valerius gives, in the first case, Tiberunco fluvio; in the
second, Tyberoboam. The various readings of the Greek manuscripts,
indicated by C. Müller in his edition (Didot, 1846), give
Boroam, Baroam, Tiberio-potamos, and lastly (MS. A.) Tibernabon.
The site fixed by Cunningham for the city of Taxila is
distinctly traversed by a river called Tabrâ Nala, which divides
into two the ancient city, and washes the foot of the citadel.
The ease of confounding the β with λ in the manuscripts permits
the correction of Tibernabon into Tibernalon. The essential
part of the name is, moreover, Tabrâ, <i>nala</i> being a designation
common to small affluents. The resemblance of the two words
Tabrânala and Tibernalos is at once apparent; the persistence
of geographical names has nothing surprising in it, especially in
India. The city of Takshaśila ought then to be placed definitely
on the banks of the Tabrânala (a small affluent of the Haro,
which bends its course to the Indus, into which it falls twelve miles
below Attock) in the position proposed by General Cunningham.”</p>

<p>Taxila, as Alexander found it, was very populous, and possessed
of almost incredible wealth. Pliny states that it was
situated on a level where the hills sink down into the plain,
while Strabo praises the soil as extremely fertile from the
number of its springs and water-courses. The Chinese pilgrim,
Hwen Thsiang, by whom it was visited in 630 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>,
and afterwards in 643, confirms what Strabo has reported.
Taxila, which in Ptolemy’s <i>Geography</i> appears as <i>Taxiala</i>,
represents either the Sanskrit Takshaśilâ, <i>i.e.</i> “hewn stone,”
or, more probably, Takshakaśilâ, <i>i.e.</i> “Rock of Takshaka,”
the great Nâga King. Others, however, take it to represent
the Pali Takkasila, <i>i.e.</i> the rock of the Takkas, a powerful tribe
which anciently occupied the regions between the Indus and the
Chenâb (v. <i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</i>, vol. xx. p. 343).
The famous Aśôka, the grandson of Chandragupta (Sandrokottos),
resided in Taxila during the lifetime of his father,
Vindusâra, as viceroy of the Panjâb. About the beginning of
the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Taxila appears to have formed part of
the dominions of the Graeco-Baktrian king, Eukratides. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
126 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> it was wrested from the Greeks by the Sus or Abars, with
whom it remained for about three-quarters of a century, when it
was conquered by the Kushân tribe under the great Kanishka.
In the year 42 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> it is said to have been visited by Apollonios
of Tyana and his companion, the Assyrian Damis, who wrote a
narrative of the journey, which Philostratos professes to have
followed in his life of Apollonios. In 400 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> it was visited by
Fa-Hian, who calls it Chu-sha-shi-lo, <i>i.e.</i> “the severed head,”
the usual name by which Taxila was known to the Buddhists of
India (<i>v.</i> Cunningham’s <i>Anc. Geog. of India</i>, pp. 104-121).</p>

<h4 id="NoteJ"><span class="smcap">Note J.—Site of Alexander’s Camp on the Hydaspês</span></h4>

<p>It is a point of great importance to determine where the camp
was situated which Alexander formed on reaching the Hydaspês,
and which he made his headquarters till he effected the passage
of the river. Without knowing this it cannot with certainty be
decided at what point he made the passage or where he defeated
Pôros, or where he founded the two cities, Nikaia and Boukephala,
which he built after his victory. Such high authorities as Sir A.
Burnes, General Court, and General Abbott have placed the
camp at Jhîlam, but Lord Elphinstone and General Cunningham
prefer Jalâlpûr, a place some thirty miles lower down the stream.
These writers all drew their conclusions from personal knowledge
of the localities concerned. Cunningham, who wrote later than
the others, visited the Hydaspês in 1863, and in his <i>Geography
of Ancient India</i> (pp. 157-179) gives an account of the scope
and results of his investigations. He points out that Alexander
in advancing from Taxila to the Hydaspês had two roads—one
called the <i>upper</i>, which proceeded through a rich and fertile
country, past Rawal Pindi, Manikyâla, and Rohtâs to Jhîlam,
and another called the <i>lower</i>, which proceeded, with an inclination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
to southward, to Dudhiâl, and thence by Asanot and Vang
to Jalâlpûr. He then shows from Strabo and Pliny that Alexander
must have advanced by the <i>lower</i> road. According to
Strabo (XV. i. 32), “the direction of Alexander’s march, as far
as the Hydaspês, was, for the most part, towards the south;
after that, to the Hypanis, it was more towards the <i>east</i>.” Now,
if Alexander had taken the route by Jhîlam he would have
advanced in one continuous straight line, which is in direct
opposition to the explicit statement of Strabo, which makes him
deviate towards the south. Pliny again (vi. 21), quoting from
Diognêtos and Baitôn, the <i>mensores</i> of Alexander, gives the
distance from Taxila to the Hydaspês as 120 (Roman) miles.
In comparing this distance with that from Shah-Dheri to Jhîlam
and Jalâlpûr respectively, we must reject Jhîlam, which is no less
than sixteen miles short of the recorded distance, while Jalâlpûr
differs from it by less than two miles. The same author thinks
that the camp probably extended for about six miles along the
bank of the river from Shah Kabir, two miles to the north-east of
Jalâlpûr, down to Syadpûr, four miles to the west-south-west. In
this position the left flank of the camp would have been only
six miles from the wooded promontory of Kotera, where he intended
to steal his passage across the river. The breadth of the
Hydaspês at Jalâlpûr is about a mile and a quarter.</p>

<h4 id="NoteK"><span class="smcap">Note K.—Battle with Pôros</span></h4>

<p>To the accounts of this memorable battle given by Arrian
and the four other writers translated in this volume, I here add
the account of it given by Polyainos in his work <i>On the
Stratagems of War</i> (II. ix. 22):</p>

<p>“Alexander, in his Indian expedition, advanced to the
Hydaspês with intention to cross it, when Porus appeared with
his army on the other side determined to dispute his passage.
Alexander then marched towards the head of the river, and
attempted to cross it there. Thither also Porus marched, and
drew up his army on the opposite side. He then made the
same effort lower down; there, too, Porus opposed him. Those
frequent appearances of intention to cross it, without ever
making one real attempt to effect it, the Indians ridiculed, and,
concluding that he had no real design to pass the river, they
became more negligent in attending his motions, when Alexander,
by a rapid march gaining the banks, effected his purpose on
barges, boats, and hides stuffed with straw, before the enemy
had time to come up with him, who, deceived by so many feint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
attempts, yielded him at last an uninterrupted passage. In the
battle against Porus, Alexander posted part of his cavalry in the
right wing, and part he left as a body of reserve at a small
distance on the plain. His left wing consisted of the phalanx
and his elephants. Porus ordered his elephants to be formed
against him, himself taking his station on an elephant at the
head of his left wing. The elephants were drawn up within
fifty yards of each other, and in those interstices was posted his
infantry, so that his front exhibited the appearance of a great
wall; the elephants looked like so many towers, and the infantry
like the parapet between them. Alexander directed his infantry
to attack the enemy in front, while himself at the head of the
horse advanced against the cavalry. Against those movements
Porus ably guarded. But the beasts could not be kept in their
ranks, and, wherever they deserted them, the Macedonians in a
compact body pouring in closed with the enemy, and attacked
them both in front and flank. The body of reserve, in the
meantime wheeling round and attacking their rear, completed
the defeat” (<i>Shepherd’s Translation</i>).</p>

<p>Grote, referring to this battle, remarks that “the day on
which it was fought was the greatest day of Alexander’s life, if
we take together the splendour and difficulty of the military
achievement and the generous treatment of his conquered
opponent.” Military critics cannot point to a single strategical
error in the whole series of operations conducted by Alexander
himself, or his generals acting under his orders, from the
time he encamped on the bank of the Hydaspês till the overthrow
and surrender of Pôros. At the same time the courage
and skill with which the Indian king contended against the
greatest soldier of antiquity, if not of all time, are worthy of the
highest admiration, and present a striking contrast to the incompetent
generalship and pusillanimity of Darius. “The Greeks,”
says General Chesney, “were loud in praises of the Indians;
never in all their eight years of constant warfare had they met
with such skilled and gallant soldiers, who, moreover, surpassed
in stature and bearing all the other races of Asia.... The
Indian village community flourished even at that distant period,
and in the brave and manly race which fought so stoutly under
Porus twenty-two centuries ago we may recognise all the fine
qualities of the Punjabi agrarian people of the present day, the
gallant men who fought us in our turn so stubbornly, now the
most valuable component of the Indian empire, and the best
soldiers of its Queen-Empress.”</p>

<h4 id="NoteL"><span class="smcap">Note L.—The Kathaians</span></h4>

<p>The Kathaioi, it would appear from the text, inhabited the
regions lying to the east of the Hydraôtês. Some writers,
however, as Strabo informs us (XV. i. 30), placed their country in
the tract between the Hydaspês and Akesinês, but this view is
manifestly wrong. They are described by ancient authors as one
of the most powerful nations of India. Their very name indicates
their warlike propensities and predominance, for if it is not
identical with that of the military caste, <i>Kshatriya</i>, it is at least
a modified form of that word. Arrian subsequently (vi. 15)
mentions a tribe of independent Indians whose name is a still
closer transliteration of <i>Kshatriya</i>, the <i>Xathroi</i>, whose territories
lay between the Indus and the lower course of the Akesinês.
Strabo (XV. i. 30) notices some of the peculiar manners and
customs of the Kathaians, such as infanticide, and Sati. Lassen
has pointed out that their name is connected with that of the
Kattia, a nomadic race scattered at intervals through the plains
of the Panjâb, but supposed to be the aborigines of the country
and of Kolarian descent. Their name occurs in that of the
province of Kâthiawâr, which now comprises the province of
Gujerat.</p>

<h4 id="NoteM"><span class="smcap">Note M.—Sangala</span></h4>

<p>Sir E. H. Bunbury, referring to the uncertainty of the
identifications of the tribes and cities of the Panjâb mentioned
by Alexander’s historians, says: “While the general course of his
march must have followed approximately the same line of route
that has been frequented in all ages from the banks of the Indus
to those of the Beas, his expeditions against the various warlike
tribes that refused submission to his arms led him into frequent
excursions to the right and left of his main direction. And with
regard to these localities we have a general clue to guide us.
The most important of these sites to determine would be that of
Sangala, the capital of the Cathaeans, which, according to the
narrative of Arrian, was situated between the Hydraotes and the
Hyphasis. Hence it was placed by Burnes at Lahore, and by
others at Umritsir. But on the other hand there are not wanting
strong reasons for identifying Sangala with the Sakala of Indian
writers, and this was certainly situated to the west of the Hydraotes,
between that river and the Acesines” (<i>Hist. of Anc. Geog.</i> pp.
444, 445). This was the view of General Cunningham, who, taking
<i>Śâkala</i> or <i>Sâkala</i> (the <i>Sagala</i> of Ptolemy’s <i>Geography</i>) to be the
name in Sanskrit of the place which the Greeks called <i>Sangala</i>, found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
a site for it at Sânglawâla-Tiba, a small rocky hill with ruins upon
it and with a large swamp at its base, and situated between the
Râvi (Hydraôtês) and the Chenâb (Akesinês) at a distance of about
sixty miles to the west of Lahore. This was no doubt the site of
the Śâkala of Sanskrit writers and of the She-kie-lo of the Chinese
pilgrim Hwen Thsiang, who visited the place in 630 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> But
it cannot have been the site of the Sangala of the Greeks, for, in
the first place, according to the testimony of all the historians,
that city lay between the Hydraôtês and the Hyphasis, and was
attacked by Alexander after he had crossed the former river. To
meet this objection Cunningham assumes that Alexander must
have recrossed the Hydraôtês on hearing that the Kathaians had
risen in his rear. His thus turning aside from the direction of
his march to make his rear secure is quite consistent with his
usual practice, but the historians say nothing from which it can
possibly be inferred that on this occasion he made any retrograde
movement. But again philology as well as history is adverse
to this identification, for, as has lately been shown by M. Sylvain
Lévi (<i>Journal Asiatique</i>, series viii. vol. xv. pp. 237-239), <i>Sangala</i>,
in accordance with the rules of transcription, must be taken to
represent not <i>Sâkala</i>, but <i>Sâmkala</i>. Now, just as in Diodôros
and Curtius we find Sangala mentioned in connection with a king
called Sôphytês, so in an Appendix to Pânini’s <i>Grammar</i>, called
the Gana-pâtha, <i>Sâmkala</i> is mentioned in connection with
<i>Saubhuta</i>, which, in accordance with the rules of transcription
and the Greek practice of designating Indian rulers after their
territories, is evidently the name of the country over which
Sôphytês ruled. This country, which was rich and prosperous, as
its very name implies, lay between the Hydraôtês and the
Hyphasis, probably in the district of Amritsar and towards the
hills. Arrian in his narrative of the campaign between these two
rivers makes no mention of Sôphytês, or, as he calls him,
Sôpeithes, but he afterwards refers to a king of this name whose
dominions lay between the Hydaspês and Akesinês. Strabo
was aware of the discrepancy of the accounts as to where the
dominions of the Kathaians and King Sôphytês were situated.</p>

<h4 id="NoteN"><span class="smcap">Note N.—Alexander’s Altars on the Hyphasis</span></h4>

<p>These altars are mentioned by Pliny, who says (vi. 21): “The
Hyphasis was the limit of the marches of Alexander, who, however,
crossed it, and dedicated altars on the further bank.”
Pliny stands alone in placing these altars on the left bank of
the river. The historians all place them on the right bank.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
Philostratos states that Apollonios of Tyana on his journey into
India in the second century of our aera, found the altars still
subsisting and their inscriptions still legible. Plutarch affirms
that in his days they were held in much veneration by the
Praisians, whose kings, he says, were in the habit of crossing the
Ganges every year to offer sacrifices in the Grecian manner upon
them. It would, however, be unsafe to place much credit in
either of these statements. The altars have been sought for in
recent times, but not the slightest vestige of them has been
discovered. Masson and some other modern writers place them
on the Gharra (the united stream of the Vipaśâ and the Śatadru
(or Satlej), but this view, while otherwise exposed to serious
objections, is upset by the fact alone that in ancient times the
two rivers united at a point forty miles below their present junction.
As Pliny (vi. 21) gives the distance from the Hyphasis to the
Hesidrus (Satlej) along the Royal Road at 169 miles, it is evident
that the altars must have been situated at a point high above
the junction of these two rivers. V. de Saint-Martin is inclined
to think that the altars may have been situated near a chain of
heights met with in ascending the Beiâs, and known locally under
the name of the <i>Sekandar-giri</i>, that is, “Alexander’s mountain.”
These heights are at no great distance from Râjagiri, a small and
obscure place, but supposed to represent Râjagriha mentioned
in the <i>Râmâyana</i> as the capital of a line of princes called the
Aśvapati (or <i>Assapati</i> in Prakrit) who governed the Kekaya, or,
as Arrian calls them in his <i>Indika</i>, the Kêkeoi. Lassen, followed
by Saint-Martin, identified Sôpeithes as belonging to the line of
princes indicated. The identification has been superseded by a
better, but Saint-Martin’s argument, as far as it concerns the
position of the altars, is not thereby affected. Sir E. H. Bunbury
considers that the point where Alexander erected the twelve
altars cannot be regarded as determined within even approximate
limits. It appears probable, he thinks, that they were situated at
some distance above the confluence of the two rivers, and not
very far from the point where the Beas emerges from the
mountain ranges. We learn indeed, he adds, that throughout
his advance Alexander kept as near as he could to the mountains;
partly from the idea that he would thus find the great rivers more
easily passable, as being nearer their sources; partly from an
exaggerated impression of the sterile and desert character of the
plains farther south (<i>Hist. of Anc. Geog.</i> p. 444).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span></p>

<h4 id="NoteO"><span class="smcap">Note O.—Voyage down the Hydaspês and Akesinês
to the Indus</span></h4>

<p>From the point of embarkation at Nikaia (Mong) to the
confluence of the united streams of the Panjâb with the Indus,
the distance in a straight line may be reckoned at about 300
miles. Alexander in descending to this confluence had no
sooner left the dominions of Pôros than he was engaged in a
constant succession of hostilities with the riparian tribes. He
had no intention of leaving India as a fugitive. He must depart
as a conqueror and master of all wherever he appeared. He had
no wish, therefore, even had it been possible, to drop quietly down
stream to the ocean. He must demand submission to his
authority from all the tribes he might encounter on his way, and,
if this were refused, enforce it at the sword’s point. These tribes
were the bravest of the brave in India—the very ancestors of the
Rajputras, or Rajputs, whose splendid military qualities have
spread their fame throughout the world. Such of these tribes as
inhabited the fertile regions adjacent to the rivers seemed to have
settled in towns and villages and to have practised agriculture,
while those that tenanted the deserts which extended far eastward
into the interior led a half-wandering pastoral life, and subsisted
as much on the produce of rapine as on the produce of their
flocks and herds. They were all proudly jealous of their
independence, and owned no authority but that of their proper
chiefs. Though they were separated into distinct tribes, which were
almost perpetually at feud, they were still able when confronted
with a common danger to combine into formidable confederacies.
In all times they have opposed to invasion a vigorous and sometimes
a desperate resistance (<i>v.</i> Saint-Martin, <i>Étude</i>, p. 113).</p>

<h4 id="NoteP"><span class="smcap">Note P.—The Malloi and Oxydrakai</span></h4>

<p>The names of these two warlike tribes are very frequently
conjoined in the narratives of the historians. In Sanskrit works
they appear as the Mâlava and the Kshudraka, and a verse of the
<i>Mahâbhârata</i> combines them in a single appellation, <i>Kshudrakamâlava</i>.
They are mentioned in combination by Pânini also as
two Bahîka people of the north-west. Arrian (<i>Indika</i>, c. iv.)
places the Oxydrakai on the Hydaspês <i>above</i> its confluence with
the Akesinês. It is doubtful, however, that this was their real
position. Bunbury inclines to think that they lay on the east
or left bank of the Satlej—the province of Bahawalpur—and
that they may very well have extended as far as the junction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
of the Satlej with the Indus and the neighbourhood of Uchh.
General Cunningham, he adds, is alone in placing the Oxydracae
to the north of the Malli. That author has, however, the <i>Indika</i>
to support his view. Their name in the classics appears in
various forms, Strabo and Stephanos Byz. calling them <i>Hydrakai</i>,
Pliny <i>Sydracae</i>, and Diodôros <i>Syrakousai</i>. Strabo says they
were reported to be the descendants of Bacchos because the vine
grew in their country, and because their kings displayed great
pomp in setting out on their warlike expeditions after the Bacchic
manner (XV. i. 8). They are no doubt to be identified with the
Śudras, whose name in early times did not denote a caste, as it
did afterwards, but a tribe of aborigines, or, at all events, a tribe
of non-Aryan origin. The final <i>ka</i> in the Greek form of their
name is a common Sanskrit suffix to ethnic names given or withheld
at random. The single combat between Dioxippos and a
Macedonian bravo called Horratas took place after a great banquet
at which Alexander entertained the envoys of the Oxydrakai.</p>

<p>The territory of the Malloi was of great extent, comprehending
a part of the Doâb formed by the Akesinês and the Hydraôtês,
and extending, according to Arrian (<i>Indika</i>, c. iv.), to the confluence
of the Akesinês and the Indus. In the <i>Mahâbhârata</i> they
figure as a great people, being there distinguished into the
Eastern, Southern, and Western Mâlavas (<i>Mahâbh.</i> vi. 107). They
are mentioned also in the inscription of Samudragupta (of the
first half of the third century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) among other peoples of the
Panjâb who were subject to the King of Madhya-desha (<i>v.</i> V.
de Saint-Martin, <i>Étude</i>, pp. 116-120). “These two races,” says
Thirlwall (<i>History of Greece</i>, vii. 40), “were composed of widely
different elements; for the name of one appears to have been
derived from that of the Sudra caste; and it is certain that the
Brahmins were predominant in the other. We can easily understand
why they did not intermarry and were seldom at peace
with each other.” The feud, however, may have been one of
race rather than of caste, though no doubt the distinctions of
caste originated in difference of race.</p>

<h4 id="NoteQ"><span class="smcap">Note Q.—The Capital of the Malloi</span></h4>

<p>Diodôros and Curtius assign this city to the Oxydrakai, but
erroneously. General Cunningham identifies it with Multân and
takes it to be also the capital of the Malloi “to which many men
from other cities had fled for safety.” Arrian seems, however, to
indicate that the two places were distinct. V. de Saint-Martin
inclines to identify the Mallian capital with Harrâpa (the Harapa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
which Cunningham takes to be the city captured by Perdikkas).
Multân is at present the capital of the province of the same name,
which comprises pretty nearly the same territories as those occupied
by the Malloi of the Greek historians. Multân is not situated
on the Râvi now, but on the Chenâb, and at a distance of more
than thirty miles <i>below</i> the junction of that river with the Râvi.
This circumstance would be quite fatal to Cunningham’s view if
the junction had not shifted. But it has shifted, for in Alexander’s
time the rivers met about fifteen miles below Multân. “The old
channel (Cunningham says) still exists and is duly entered in the
large maps of the Multân division. It leaves the present bed at
Sarai Siddhû and follows a winding course for thirty miles to the
south-south-west, when it suddenly turns to the west for eighteen
miles as far as Multân, and, after completely encircling the
fortress, continues its westerly course for five miles below Multân.
It then suddenly turns to the south-south-west for ten miles, and
is finally lost in the low-lying lands of the bed of the Chenâb.
Even to this day the Râvi clings to its ancient channel, and at
all high floods the waters of the river still find their way to
Multân by the old bed, as I myself have witnessed on two occasions.
The date of the change is unknown, but was certainly
subsequent to <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 713.” From Arrian’s narrative it would
appear that Alexander occupied three days, one of which was
spent in rest, in advancing from the city of the Brachmans to the
city of the Malloi. The distance traversed would be thirty-four
miles, if Cunningham’s identification of the former city with Atâri
and of the latter with Multân be correct. The city where
Alexander was wounded appears from Arrian’s account to have
been at some distance from the Hydraôtês, and if so could not
have been Multân.</p>

<h4 id="NoteR"><span class="smcap">Note R.—Alexander in Sindh</span></h4>

<p>Arrian and the other historians of Alexander have treated
very briefly and vaguely his campaign in the valley of the Indus.
Hence it is difficult to trace the course of his operations as he
descended from the great confluence at Uchh to Patala where
the Indus bifurcates to form the Delta. The distance between
these two points, if measured by the course of the river, may be
estimated at nearly four hundred miles, yet we find, as Saint-Martin
observes, that in the descent not a single distance is indicated,
nor a single peculiar feature of the country described
which might serve as a sign-post for the direction and guidance
of our inquiries. It is at the same time difficult to reconcile the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
discrepancies found to exist in the accounts transmitted to us,
and altogether the search for identities must here mainly concern
itself with the names of tribes. In determining how these tribes
were collocated it is necessary to take cognisance of the changes
which have taken place in the course of the Indus since Alexander’s
time. Captain M’Murdo was the first to call attention
(in 1834) to these changes, which were not confined to the
terminal course of the river, but extended more than two hundred
miles above the Delta. He proved that up to the seventh century
of our aera the main stream of the Indus, instead of following its
present channel, pursued a more direct course to the sea some
sixty or seventy miles farther east than it now flows. The old
channel, which leaves the present stream at some distance above
Bhakar, passes the ruins of Alôr, and then proceeds directly
towards the south nearly as far as Brâhmanâbâd, above which it
divides into two channels, one rejoining the present course above
Haidarâbâd, while the other pursues a south-easterly course
towards the Ran of Kachh. The voyage down the lower part of
the course took place during the season of the inundation when
the plains were laid far and wide under water, and the current was
rapid and violent. As the march followed mainly the line of the
river the country would appear to the Macedonians extremely
rich, fertile, and populous, while the sterility of the regions
that lay beyond the reach of the inundations would seldom be
brought under their cognisance. In descending the river they
could not fail to notice the contrast presented by the plains on
its opposite banks, those on the east exhibiting a uniform expanse
without any visible boundary, while those on the west were
hemmed in by a great mountain rampart which in running southwards
gradually approached the Indus till the roots of the hills
were laved by its waters. The inhabitants would strike them as
being more swarthy in their complexion than the men of the
Panjâb, from whom they differed also in their political predilections,
as they preferred kingly government to republican
independence, and allowed the Brahman to exercise a decisive
influence over public life. The descent of the Indus by Alexander,
as Bunbury remarks, may be considered as constituting a
kind of aera in the geographical knowledge of the Greeks. It
does not appear, he adds, that it was ever repeated; and while
subsequent researches added materially to the knowledge possessed
by the Greeks of the valley of the Ganges and the more
easterly provinces of India, their information concerning the
great river Indus and the regions through which it flows continued
to be derived almost exclusively from the voyage of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
Alexander and the accounts transmitted by the contemporary
historians.</p>

<p>After leaving the great confluence the first tribe Alexander
reached were the <i>Sogdoi</i>, who appear as the <i>Sodrai</i> in Diodôros,
who states that Alexander founded among them on the banks of
the river a city called Alexandreia in which he placed 10,000
inhabitants. The Sogdoi have been identified with the <i>Sohda</i>
Rajputs who now occupy the south-east district of Sindh about
Amarkot, but who in former times held large possessions on the
banks of the Indus to the northward of Alôr. This place, though
now only a scene of ruins, was formerly, before it was deserted by
the river, one of the largest and most flourishing cities in all
Sindh. Saint-Martin takes it to have been the Sogdian capital,
and thinks that the city which Alexander founded lay in its
vicinity at Rôri, since right opposite to this place there rose in
the middle of the river the rocky island of Bhakar, which presented
every natural advantage for the site of a great fortress. Cunningham,
however, would place the capital higher up stream, about
midway between Alôr and Uchh, at a village which appears in old
maps under the name of Sirwahi, and which may possibly represent
the <i>Seori</i> of Sindh history and the <i>Sodrai</i> of Diodôros. In this
neighbourhood lies the most frequented ghât for the crossing of
the Indus towards the west <i>viâ</i> Gandâva and the Bolan Pass;
and as the ghâts always determine the roads, it was probably at
this point of passage Krateros recrossed the Indus when he was
despatched with the main body of the army and the elephants to
return home through the countries in which that Pass lay. The
name <i>Sodrai</i>, some think, represents the Sanskrit <i>Śûdra</i> which
designates the servile or lowest of the four castes. If this be so,
the Sodrai may be regarded as a remnant of the primitive stock
which peopled the country before the advent of the Aryans (<i>v.</i>
Lassen, <i>Ind. Alt.</i> ii. p. 174; Saint-Martin, <i>Étude</i>, pp. 150-161;
Cunningham, <i>Anc. Geog. of India</i>, pp. 249-256).</p>

<h4 id="NoteS"><span class="smcap">Note S.—Sindimana</span></h4>

<p>Sambus is called Sabus by Curtius, who, without giving the
name of his capital, informs us that Alexander captured it by
mining and then marched to rejoin his fleet on the Indus. The
Greek name of this capital, <i>Sindimana</i>, has led to its identification
with Sehwân, a site of very high antiquity. The great mound
which was once its citadel has been formed chiefly of ruined
buildings accumulated in the course of ages on a scarped rock at
the end of the Lakki range of hills. Its water supply is at present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
entirely derived from the Indus, which not only flows under the
eastern front of the town, but also along the northern by a channel
from the great Manchur Lake, which perhaps formerly extended
up even to the city walls. The objection to this identification,
that Sehwân’s position on the Indus conflicts with the statement
that Alexander had to march from Sindomana to reach that river,
is removed by the fact that the Indus has changed its course since
Alexander’s time. Wilson derives the Greek Sindomana from
what he calls a very allowable Sanskrit compound, <i>Sindu-mân</i>,
“the possessor of Sindh.” Cunningham, however, would refer
the name to <i>Saindava-vanam</i> or <i>Sainduwân</i>, “the abode of the
Saindavas.” <i>v.</i> his <i>Anc. Geog. of India</i>, pp. 263-266, and also
Saint-Martin’s <i>Étude</i>, p. 166, where it is stated that the name of
Sambus is probably connected with that of the tribe called
Sammah, whose chiefs have at different epochs played a distinguished
part in the valley of the Indus. In Hindu mythology
<i>Samba</i> is the son of Krishna. According to Plutarch, it was
somewhere in the dominions of Sabbas that Alexander had his
interview with the ten Indian gymnosophists. Sehwân is the
Sewistan of the Arabs. According to Burton (writing in 1857), it
is a hot, filthy, and most unwholesome place, with a rascally
population (of 6000) which includes many beggars and devotees.
<i>v.</i> his <i>Sindh</i>, p. 8. The population has since increased to upwards
of 160,000.</p>

<h4 id="NoteT"><span class="smcap">Note T.—City of the Brachmans—Harmatelia</span></h4>

<p>This city of the Brachmans Cunningham takes to have been
Brâhmana, or Brâhmanâbâd, which was ninety miles distant by
water from Marija Dand, the point where he supposes Alexander
rejoined his fleet after the capture of Sindimana. Brâhmanâbâd
was situated on the old channel of the Indus forty-seven miles to
the north-east of Haidarâbâd or Nirankot, the Patala of ancient
times. Shortly after the Mohammedan conquest it was supplanted
by Mansûra, which either occupied its site or lay very
near it, as, according to Ibn Haukal, the place was called in
the Sindh language Bâmiwân. It was destroyed by an earthquake
sometime before the beginning of the eleventh century.
Its ruins were discovered at Bambhra-ka-thûl by Mr. Bellasis,
whose excavations have shown conclusively the truth of the
popular tradition which ascribed its downfall to an earthquake.
Cunningham further thinks that Brâhmanâbâd was the <i>Harmatelia</i>
of Diodôros—the place where Ptolemy was wounded by the
poisoned arrow. Harmatelia (he says) is only a softer pronunciation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
of <i>Brâhma-thala</i> or Brahmana-sthala, just as Hermes, the
phallic god of the Greeks, is the same as Brahmâ, the original
phallic god of the Indians. He thinks that the king whom
Justin (xii. 10) calls <i>Ambiger</i> was no other than Mousikanos,
whose dominions extended as far south as the Delta, <i>Ambiger</i>
being his family name and Mousikanos his dynastic title (<i>Geog.</i>
pp. 267-269). Saint-Martin, on the other hand, recognises Harmatelia
in a place variously designated by Arab writers <i>Armael</i>,
<i>Armaïl</i>, <i>Armâbil</i>, and <i>Armatel</i>, but of which the position is unknown
(<i>Étude</i>, pp. 167, 168). In his ancient map of India
Colonel Yule, who takes the same view as Saint-Martin, identifies
Harmatelia with Bela.</p>

<h4 id="NoteU"><span class="smcap">Note U.—Patala</span></h4>

<p>The situation of Patala has been a fertile theme of controversy.
Arrian seems, no doubt, to give here a clear indication of its
position in saying that it stood near where the Indus bifurcates;
but as this point has from time to time shifted, the controversy
has turned mainly on the question where this point is to be fixed.
The river bifurcates at present at Mottâri, which lies twelve miles
above Haidarâbâd, and it has been known to bifurcate a little
above, and also a little below Thatha, at Bauna also, and at
Trikul. As a matter of fact, these bifurcations no longer exist,
except perhaps for a part of the year when the river is in flood
and recurs to some of its old channels. It is not then surprising
that various identifications have been proposed for Patala. It
was placed at Brâhmanâbâd by M’Murdo, Wilson, and Lassen;
at Thatha by Rennell, Vincent, Ritter, and the two brothers,
James and Sir Alexander Burnes; and at Haidarâbâd, the
Nirankot of Arab writers, by Droysen, Benfey, Burton, Saint-Martin,
Cunningham, and Bunbury. The arguments in favour
of Haidarâbâd seem to be quite conclusive. They will be found
stated at length in Saint-Martin’s <i>Étude</i> (pp. 168-191), and
Cunningham’s <i>Geography</i> (pp. 279-287). One of the most
cogent is that the dimensions of the Delta, as given by the Greek
writers, are only justified if the apex of the Delta is taken to have
been in Alexander’s time at or near Haidarâbâd. If the apex
had then been as high up as Brâhmanâbâd, or as far down as
Thatha, the size of the Delta would be as grossly exaggerated in
the one case as it would be underrated in the other. The same
conclusion is indicated in the information supplied to the late
Dr. Wilson of Bombay by the Brahmans of Sehwân, that, according
to their local legends, as recorded in their Sanskrit books,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
Thatha was <i>Déval</i>, and Haidarâbâd <i>Néran</i>, and more anciently
<i>Patolpuri</i>. <i>Patala</i> was thought at one time to have been a transcription
of the Sanskrit Pâtâla, <i>the nether world</i>, into which the
sun descends at the end of his day’s journey, and hence <span class="smcap">the
West</span>; but a better etymology is the Sanskrit <i>potala</i>, “a station
for ships,” from <i>pôta</i>, “a vessel.” The name of the Indian Delta
was Patalênê. Haidarâbâd stands on a long flat-topped hill, and
Patala, if this was its site, must have occupied a commanding
position, the advantages of which, alike for strategy and commerce,
Alexander would perceive at a glance. The main stream of the
Indus now flows to the west of this position. In the second chapter
of his <i>Indika</i> Arrian repeats the statement that the Indus enters
the ocean by two mouths. Aristoboulos estimated the interval
between them at 1000 stadia, but Nearchos at 1800. The interval
from the west to the east arm measures at present 125
British miles. The sea-front of the Egyptian Delta with which
the Greeks compared that of the Indus Delta is not less than
160 miles. The Prince of Patala was called <i>Moeris</i>.</p>

<h4 id="NoteV"><span class="smcap">Note V.—Alexander’s March through Gedrôsia-Pura</span></h4>

<p>“No traveller,” says Bunbury, referring to the interior of Mekran,
“has as yet traversed its length from one end to the other
in the direction followed by Alexander. So far as we can judge,
he appears to have kept along a kind of plain or valley, which
is found to run nearly parallel to the coast between the interior
range of the Mushti (or Washati) hills and the lower ragged hills
that bound the immediate neighbourhood of the sea-coast. This
line of route has been followed in very recent times by Major
Ross from Kedj to Bela, and seems to form a natural line of
communication, keeping throughout about the required distance
(60 or 70 miles) from the coast [the distance required for maintaining
communication with the fleet].... This line of march
so far as is yet known does not appear to traverse any such
frightful deserts <i>of sand</i> as those described by the historians of
Alexander. Nor can the site of Pura ... be determined with
accuracy. It has been generally identified with Bunpoor (Banpûr),
the most important place in Western Beloochistan, or with
Pahra, a village in the same neighbourhood; but the resemblance
of name is in this case of little value—<i>poor</i> signifying merely a
town—while the remoteness of Bunpoor from the sea, and its
position to the north of the central chain of mountains, which
Alexander must therefore have traversed in order to reach it,
present considerable difficulties in the way of this view” (<i>Hist. of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
Anc. Geog.</i> pp. 519-520). Strabo, in his chapter on Ariana,
narrates in graphic detail, like Arrian, the sufferings experienced
by the Macedonians in passing through Gedrôsia. The summer,
he says, was purposely chosen for leaving India, since rains then
fall in Gedrôsia, filling the rivers and wells which fail in winter.
Alexander kept at the utmost from the sea not more than 500
stadia in order to secure the coast for his fleet. The army was
saved by eating dates and the marrow of the palm-tree, but many
persons were suffocated by eating unripe dates.</p>

<p>To account for the surprising length of time (60 days) occupied
on this march, which could not have exceeded 400 English miles,
we must suppose that the troops were obliged to make frequent
halts at places where water was procurable. Strabo says that it
was found necessary on account of the watering-places to make
marches of two, four, and even sometimes of six hundred stadia
generally during the night. The land distances, like the sea
distances of Nearchos, seem to have been grossly exaggerated.
The march of Semiramis through this desert and that of Cyrus
seem to be mythical. Alexander’s loss in men during the march
must have been exaggerated by the historians, as he brought the
bulk of his army with him to Pura.</p>

<h4 id="NoteW"><span class="smcap">Note W.—Indian Sages</span></h4>

<p>According to Megasthenes the Indian sages were divided into
two sects, Brahmans and Sarmans. There was besides a third
sect, described as quarrelsome, fond of wrangling, foolish and
boastful. The Brahmans, he says, were held in higher esteem
than the Sarmans because there was more agreement in their
doctrines. Among the Sarmans the Hylobioi (<i>living in woods</i>)
were held in most honour, and next to them the physicians, who
are mendicants and also ascetics, like the class above them and
the class below them, which consisted of sorcerers and fortune-tellers.
Megasthenes has related at some length the nature of
the opinions and practices of all these sects, and Duncker considers
that in all essential points his accounts agree with the
native authorities, though the view taken may be here and there
too favourable, in some points too advanced, in others not sufficiently
discriminating. “It is true,” he says, “that the Brahmans
and the initiated of the Enlightened (Buddhists), the Śramanas,
are confounded in the order of the sages; this is shown by the
statement that any one could enter into this order.... In the
description of the life of the ascetics and wandering sages, the
Brahmans and Bhikshus (mendicants) are again confounded, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
if the Greeks tell us that the severe sages of the forest were too
proud to go to the court at the request of the king, the statement
holds good according to the evidence of the Epos of the Brahmanic
saints, and the Sutras of the great teachers among the Buddhists.
In the examination of the doctrines of the Indian sages, Megasthenes
distinguished the Brahmans and the Buddhists, inasmuch
as he opposes the less-honoured sects to the first, and declares
the Brahmans to be the most important. From his whole account
it is clear that at his date, <i>i.e.</i> about the year 300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
the Brahmans had distinctly the upper hand. But, according to
him, the Śramanas took the next place to the Brahmans among
the less-honoured sects. Among the Buddhists Śramana is the
ordinary name for their clergy” (<i>Hist. of Antiq.</i> pp. 422-424).</p>

<h4 id="NoteX"><span class="smcap">Note X.—The Indian Month</span></h4>

<p>Curtius apparently means that the Indians mark time, not by
taking a month to be the period from full moon to next full
moon, but from new moon to full moon. “The year of the
Indians (says Duncker) was divided into 12 months of 30 days;
the month was divided into two halves of 15 days each, and the
day into 30 hours (<i>muhurta</i>). In order to bring this year of 360
days into harmony with the natural time, the Brahmans established
a quinquennial cycle of 1860 lunar days. Three years
had 12 months of 30 lunar days; the third and fifth year of the
cycle had 13 months of the same number of days. The Brahmans
do not seem to have perceived that by this arrangement
the cycle contained almost four days in excess of the astronomical
time, and indeed they were not very skilful astronomers” (<i>v.</i> his
<i>History of Antiquity</i>, iv. 283, 284). According to Weber this system
of calculating time was borrowed from the Babylonians, but Max
Müller and learned Hindus hold it to be indigenous. The Indian
name for the half of a lunar month is <i>paksha</i>. The half from
new moon to full moon was called at first <i>pûrva</i> (fore), and afterwards
<i>śukla</i> (bright); the other half was called <i>apara</i> (posterior),
and afterwards <i>krishna</i> (dark). Le Clerc concludes his criticism
of this passage thus: “Matthaeus Raderus endeavours to explain
Curtius as if he designed to demonstrate that one month began
and was understood to commence a little after the change to the
full moon, and the next, from the time when she began to decrease
to the next change. This, indeed, ought to be his meaning;
but it is strangely expressed, when he tells us that the moon
begins to show herself horned on the sixteenth day, when ’tis
evident she does not appear so till about seven days after full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
moon. But before Raderus, Thomas Lydiat had tried to solve
the matter otherways. However, Scaliger, in his <i>Prolegomena</i>
to his <i>Canones Isagogicae</i>, p. 11, has plainly showed that Lydiat
neither understood Curtius nor Curtius the author which he
copied from. The ancient Persians counted 15 days to each of
their months, and 24 of these months to the solar year, before
the introduction of Mohammedism, as John Chardin evidently
demonstrates in his <i>Itinerarium Persicum</i>, tome xi. p. 14, quarto”
(<i>v.</i> Rooke’s <i>Arrian</i>, p. 12).</p>

<h4 id="NoteY"><span class="smcap">Note Y.—Battle with Pôros</span></h4>

<p>Mr. Heitland has the following note on this passage: “Arrian
(v. 16, sec. 2) tells us that Alexander was making a flanking
movement (παρήλαυνεν) with the bulk of his cavalry to attack
the enemy’s left wing. He then goes on (sec. 3): <i>Against the
right wing he sent Koinos at the head of his own regiment of horse
and that of Dêmêtrios, and ordered him, when the barbarians on
seeing what a dense mass of cavalry was opposed to them, should be
riding along to encounter it, to hang close upon their rear</i>,<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> a
hard passage, it is true, but one which need not be unintelligible
to any one who bears in mind that Alexander’s movement was a
flanking one, and reads with care the description of his attack in
c. 16, sec. 4, and c. 17, sec. 1, 2. The situation is this: Alexander
was not himself in position on the right wing, but put
Coenus there with some of the cavalry, while he himself with the
main body made the flanking movement. This he did with
speed, so as to take the Indian horse in flank, before they had
time to change their front and meet him. They tried to execute
this movement, but had not time; and while they were in the
confusion thus brought about, Coenus fell upon what had been
their front, but was now their disordered flank. Whether the
Indian horse from their right wing was brought over to succour
that on their left or not, does not affect the probable position of
Coenus. The one difficulty in the way of this explanation is the
presence, according to Arrian, 15, sec. 7, of the war-chariots in
front of the Indian horse. But it seems easier to suppose that
Coenus was able to elude these clumsy adversaries than that
Alexander expected him to see from the Macedonian left the
right moment for his own charge, and then wheel round the rear
of the whole Indian army and execute his orders opportunely.
Diodorus, xvii. 88, says: <i>The Macedonian cavalry began the action,
and destroyed nearly all the chariots of the Indians</i>.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> If this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
refers, as I think it does, to the beginning of the main battle, the
chief objection is removed” (<i>Alexander in India</i>, pp. 122, 123).
This explanation is different from that offered by Moberly, as the
reader will see by referring to my note on Arrian, <a href="#Footnote_106">p. 104, <i>n.</i> 2</a>.</p>

<h4 id="NoteZ"><span class="smcap">Note Z.—Indian Serpents</span></h4>

<p>Diodôros gives the length of the serpents at sixteen cubits, or
about twenty-four feet. Ailianos also gives this as their length.
He says (xvii. 2): “Kleitarchos states that about India a serpent
sixteen cubits long is produced, but mentions there is another
kind which differs in appearance from the rest. They are many
sizes shorter, and display to the eye a variety of colours, as if
they were painted with pigments. Stripes extend from the head
to the tail, and are of various colours, some tinted like bronze,
some like silver, some like gold, while others are crimson. The
same writer notices that their bite proves very quickly fatal.”
Arrian in his <i>Indika</i> (c. 15) states on the authority of Nearchos that
there are serpents in India spotted and nimble in their movements,
and that one was caught which measured about sixteen
cubits, though the Indians alleged that the largest snakes were
much larger. Nearchos adds that Alexander summoned to his
camp all the Indians most expert in the healing art, and that
these succeeded in curing snake-bites, to find a remedy for
which quite baffled the skill of all the Greek physicians. Strabo
relates (XV. i. 28), that Abisaros, as the ambassadors he sent to
Alexander reported, kept two serpents, one of 80 cubits, and
the other, according to Onesikritos, of 140 cubits in length;
but Strabo no more believed in this land-serpent than we do in
the sea-serpent, for he adds that Onesikritos might as well be
called the master-fabulist as the master-pilot of Alexander. He
afterwards says that Aristoboulos saw a snake nine cubits and a
span long, and that he himself while in Egypt had seen another
of the same length which had been brought from India. Megasthenes
wrote that serpents in India grow to such a size that they
swallow deer and oxen whole. He referred no doubt to the
python. The python of the Sunderbuns about the mouths of
the Ganges are known to swallow deer whole. The Elzevir
editor of Curtius cites statements about the size of Indian
serpents which leave the extravagant estimate of Onesikritos far
behind. Thus Maximus Tyrius (<i>Dissert.</i> 38) says: “Taxiles
showed Alexander various wonders, and among these was a very
large animal sacred to Bacchus, to which the Indians every day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
immolated victims. This animal was a serpent (<i>draco</i>), of such
a size that it equalled five acres of land.”</p>

<h4 id="NoteAa"><span class="smcap">Note A<i>a</i>.—Indian Peacocks</span></h4>

<p>The peacock (<i>mayûra</i>) abounds in India especially in the
forests at the foot of the Himalayas. Ailianos has several
notices of it in his work on animals. In Book v. 21, after he has
described its habits, and the pride it takes in displaying its
gorgeous plumage, he states that it was brought into Greece
from the barbarians. Being for a long time rare, it was exhibited
at the beginning of each month to the men and women of
Athens who were lovers of the beautiful. The charge for
admission to the spectacle was a considerable source of gain.
The price of a pair (cock and hen) was a thousand drachmas
(or about £40 of our money). Alexander the Macedonian, on
seeing these birds in India, was so struck with admiration of
their beauty that he denounced the severest penalties against
any one who should kill them. In Book xvi. 2 he notes that
the Indian peacocks are the largest to be anywhere found. In
xiii. 18 he says: “In the palace where the greatest of all the
Indian kings resides, besides many things else which excite
admiration, eclipsing the splendour alike of Memnonian Sousa
and all the boasted magnificence of Ekbatana, there are reared
in the Royal Park tame peacocks and tame pheasants....
Within that park are shady groves, grassy meads planted with
trees, and bowers woven by the craft of skilful woodmen. So
genial withal is the climate, that the trees are ever green, and
never show signs of age, nor even shed their leaves. Some are
native to the soil, while others which are brought with great care
from foreign parts, contribute to enhance the beauty of the
landscape. Not the olive, however, which is neither indigenous
to India, nor thrives if brought into it. The park is therefore
frequented by wild birds as well as by the tame. They seek its
groves from choice, and there build their nests and rear their
young. Parrots too are bred there, which, flitting to and fro,
keep hovering around the king. Notwithstanding they are so
numerous, no Indian will eat them, for they regard them as
sacred, while the Brahmans esteem them above all other birds,
and with good reason, since the parrot alone with a clear utterance
repeats the words of human speech.” In xi. 33 he tells a
story about a peacock of extraordinary size and beauty, which had
been sent from India as a present to the King of Egypt, who
thereupon dedicated the bird to Jupiter, the guardian god of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
capital city. His work has several other passages which refer to
the peacock; but as these have no bearing upon India we do
not cite them. The bird was introduced into Greece long before
Alexander’s time, for Dêmos, the friend of Perikles, reared peacocks
at Athens, which many people came from Lacedaemon and
Thessaly to see, as we learn from Athenaios, ix. 12. It is said
that peacocks were first introduced into Greece from Samos.</p>

<h4 id="NoteBb"><span class="smcap">Note B<i>b</i>.—Indian Dogs</span></h4>

<p>A breed of dogs, large, powerful, and of untamable ferocity, is
still found in the parts of India here mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Pliny, speaking
of these Indian dogs, ascribes their savage disposition to the
cause mentioned by Diodôros, the tiger blood that runs in their
veins. The Indians, he says (viii. 40), assert that these dogs
are begotten from tigers, for which purpose the bitches when in
heat are tied up amid the woods. They think that the whelps
of the first and second brood are too ferocious, but they rear
those of the third. Ailianos (viii. 1) varies this statement by
saying that tigers are the offspring of the first and second connection,
but dogs of the third. He then proceeds thus: “Dogs
that boast a tiger paternity disdain to hunt deer or to enter into an
encounter with a wild boar, but delight to assail the lion as if
to show their high pedigree. So the Indians gave Alexander, the
son of Philip, a proof of the strength and mettle of these dogs in
the manner following: They let go a deer, but the dog never
stirred; then a boar, but he still remained impassive. Then they
tried a bear, but even this failed to rouse him to action. At last
they let go a lion. Then the dog fired with rage, as if he now
saw a worthy antagonist, did not hesitate for a moment, but flew
to encounter him, gripped him fast, and tried to strangle him.
Then the Indian who provided this spectacle for the king, and
who knew well the dog’s capacity of endurance, ordered his tail
to be cut off. It was accordingly cut off, but the dog took not the
least heed. The Indian ordered next one of his legs to be cut off.
This was done, but the dog held to his grip as tenaciously as at
first, just as if the dismembered limb were not his own, but
belonged to some one else. The remaining legs were then cut off in
succession, but even all this did not in the least make him relax the
vigour of his bite. Last of all, his head was severed from the
rest of his body, but even then his teeth were seen hanging on by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
the part he had first gripped, while the head dangled aloft still
clinging to the lion, though the original biter no longer existed.
Alexander was very painfully impressed by what he saw, being lost
in admiration of the dog, since after giving proof of his mettle he
perished in no cowardly fashion, but preferring to die rather
than to let his courage give way. The Indian, seeing the king’s
vexation, gave him four dogs like the one that was killed. He
was much gratified with the gift, and gave in return a suitable
equivalent. Joy at the possession of the four dogs soon obliterated
from the mind of Philip’s son his sorrow for the other.”
The same author writes nearly to the same effect in the nineteenth
chapter of his fourth book: “I reckon Indian dogs among wild
beasts, for they are of surpassing strength and ferocity, and are the
largest of all dogs. This dog despises other animals, but fights
with the lion, withstands his attacks, returns his roaring with
baying, and gives him bite for bite. In such an encounter the
dog may be worsted, but not till he has often severely galled
and wounded the lion. The lion is, however, at times worsted
by the Indian dog and killed in the chase. If a dog once
clutches a lion, he retains his hold so pertinaciously that if
one should even cut off his leg with a knife he will not let go,
however severe may be the pain he suffers, till death supervening
compels him.” Aristotle, in his <i>History of Animals</i> (viii. 28),
refers to these Indian dogs and the story of their tigrine descent.
Even an earlier mention of them is to be found in Xenophon
(<i>Kyn.</i> c. 10). We may hence infer that their fame had
spread to Greece long before Alexander’s time. Marco Polo
mentions a province in China where the people had a large breed
of dogs so fierce and bold that two of them together would
attack a lion—an animal with which that province abounded
(Yule’s ed. ii. pp. 108, 109).</p>

<h4 id="NoteCc"><span class="smcap">Note C<i>c</i>.—The Gangaridai</span></h4>

<p>This people occupied the country about the mouths of the
Ganges, and may best be described as the inhabitants of Lower
Bengal. The likeness of their name to that of the Gandaridai,
the people of Gandhâra, whose seats were in the neighbourhood
of the Indus and the Kôphên or Kâbul river, has been the source
of much confusion and error. Fortunately the notice of them in
the <i>Indika</i> of Megasthenes has been preserved both by Pliny and
Solinus, from whom we learn that they were a branch of the great
race of the Calingae, that their capital was Parthalis (Bardwan?),
and that their king had an army of 60,000 foot, 1000 horse, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
700 elephants, which was always ready for action (Pliny, vi. 18;
Solin. 52). They are mentioned in Ptolemy’s <i>Geography</i> as a
people who dwelt about the mouth of the Ganges and whose capital
was Gangê. The name of the <i>Gangaridai</i> has nothing corresponding
with it in Sanskrit, nor can it be, as Lassen supposed,
a designation first invented by the Greeks, for Phegelas used it in
describing to Alexander the races that occupied the regions
beyond the Hyphasis. According to Saint-Martin, their name
is preserved in that of the Gonghrîs of S. Bihâr, with whom
were connected the Gangayîs of North-Western and the Gangrâr
of Eastern Bengal. These designations he takes to be but variations
of the name which was originally common to them all.
Wilford, in his article on the chronology of the Hindus (<i>Asiat.
Res.</i> v. p. 269), says that “the greatest part of Bengal was known
in Sanskrit under the name of Gancaradesa, or ‘country of Gancara,’
from which the Greeks made Gangari-das.” But this view
must be rejected on the same ground as Lassen’s. The Gangaridai
are mentioned by Virgil, <i>Georg.</i> iii. l. 27. As their king, at the
time when Megasthenes recorded the strength of the army
which he maintained, was subject to Magadha, we may infer that
Sandrokottos treated the various potentates who submitted to his
arms as Alexander treated Taxilês and Pôros, permitting them to
retain as his vassals the power and dignity which they had previously
enjoyed.</p>

<h4 id="NoteDd"><span class="smcap">Note D<i>d</i>.—The Prasioi</span></h4>

<p>The Sanskrit word <i>Prâchyâs</i> (plur. of <i>Prachya</i>, “eastern”)
denoted the inhabitants of the east country, that is, the country
which lay to the east of the river Sarasvatî, now the Sursooty,
which flows in a south-western direction from the mountains
bounding the north-east part of the province of Delhi till it loses
itself in the sands of the great desert. The Magadhas, it would
seem, had, before Alexander’s advent to India, extended their
power as far as this river, and hence were called Prâchyâs by the
people who lived to the west of it. They are called by Strabo,
Arrian, and Pliny, <i>Prasioi</i>, <i>Prasii</i>; by Plutarch, <i>Praisioi</i>; by
Nikolaös Damask., <i>Praiisioi</i>; by Diodôros, <i>Brêsioi</i>; by Curtius,
<i>Pharrasii</i>; by Justin, <i>Praesides</i>. Ailianos in general writes
<i>Praisioi</i> like Plutarch, but in one passage where he quotes Megasthenes,
he transcribes the name with perfect accuracy in the
adjective form as <i>Praxiakê</i>. General Cunningham does not
agree in referring the name to <i>Prâchya</i>, as all the other modern
writers do, but takes <i>Prasii</i> to be only the Greek form of <i>Palâsiya</i>
or <i>Parâsiya</i>, a “man of <i>Palâsa</i> or <i>Parâsa</i>,” a name of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
<i>Magadha</i> of which Palibothra was the capital. This derivation,
he says, is supported by the spelling of the name given by Curtius,
who calls the people <i>Pharrasii</i>, an almost exact transcript of
Parâsiya (see his <i>Ancient Geog. of India</i>, p. 454). His view,
we think, is hardly destined to supplant the other. Ptolemy
describes in his <i>Geography</i> a small kingdom with seven cities
which he locates in the regions of the upper Ganges, and calls
Prasiakê. Kanoge is one of these cities, but Palibothra is not in
the number, appearing elsewhere as the capital of the Mandalai.
One is at a loss to understand what considerations could have
led Ptolemy to push the Prasians so far from their proper seats
and transfer their capital to another people.</p>

<h4 id="NoteEe"><span class="smcap">Note E<i>e</i>.—The Sibi</span></h4>

<p>The Sanskrit word <i>Śivi</i> denotes a country, the inhabitants of
which, <i>Sivayas</i>, may be the Sibi of Curtius and Diodôros. The
Sibi inhabited a district between the Hydaspês and the Indus,
and their capital stood at a distance of about thirty miles from
the former river, and, as appears from Diodôros, above its confluence
with the Akesinês. As they were clad with the skins of
wild beasts and were armed with clubs, they reminded the Greeks
of Herakles, who was similarly dressed and armed, and thence
arose the legend that the Sibi were the descendants of the
followers of that wandering hero. The truth, however, is that
the Sibi represent one of the chief aboriginal tribes of the regions
of the Indus. The Sanskrit poems and the Pauranik traditions
give this great tribe its real name <i>Śibi</i>, and represent it as one of
the important branches of the race which originally peopled all
the north-western region. According to Moorcroft, the inhabitants
of the district of Bimber are called Chibs, while Baber in his
<i>Memoirs</i> had mentioned a people so named as belonging to the
same parts. Arrian does not expressly mention Alexander’s
expedition against the Sibi in his <i>History</i>, but in his <i>Indika</i> (c. 5)
he thus refers to them: “So also when the Greeks came among
the <i>Sibai</i>, an Indian tribe, and observed that they wore skins,
they declared that the <i>Sibai</i> were descended from those who
belonged to the expedition of Herakles, and had been left
behind; for besides being dressed in skins, the <i>Sibai</i> carry a
cudgel and brand on their oxen the representation of a club.”
In the ordinary texts of Curtius the <i>Sibi</i> appears as the <i>Sobii</i>, and
in Justin as the <i>Silei</i>. They are mentioned in the <i>History</i> of
Orosius (iii. 19), along with a people called Gessonae, who are
evidently the people called by Diodôros the <i>Agalassi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span></p>

<h4 id="NoteFf"><span class="smcap">Note F<i>f</i>.—The Agalassians</span></h4>

<p>Curtius does not give the name of the people whom Alexander
proceeded to attack after he had received the submission of the
Sibi, but it is supplied by Diodôros, who calls them Agalasseis.
Saint-Martin says (<i>Étude</i>, p. 115) that they adjoined the eastern
side of the Sibi and occupied the country below the junction of
the Hydaspês and Akesinês. Though <i>Agalassi</i> is the most
commonly received reading of their name, yet there are many
variant readings of it, especially in the manuscripts and editions
of Justin, where we find <i>Agesinae</i>, <i>Hiacensanae</i>, <i>Argesinae</i>, <i>Agini</i>,
<i>Acensoni</i>, and <i>Gessonae</i>. The last form occurs also in the <i>History</i>
of Orosius (iii. 19), where the people it designates are mentioned
along with the Sibi. The original name to which these may be
referred is probably <i>Arjunâyana</i>. This name occurs between
that of the Mâlava (Malloi) and that of the Yaudheyas on the
Pillar at Allahabad, whereon Samudragupta, who reigned towards
the end of the 4th century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, inscribed the names of the
countries and peoples included in his dominions. The Arjunâyana
are mentioned also by the Scholiast of Pânini, and in the
geographical list which Wilford compiled from the <i>Varâha
Sanhita</i>. Arrian in his <i>Indika</i> (c. 4) calls the people situated
at the junction of the Hydaspês and Akesinês the <i>Arispai</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>
p. 116, and footnotes).</p>

<h4 id="NoteGg"><span class="smcap">Note G<i>g</i>.—Tides in Indian Rivers</span></h4>

<p>Several Indian rivers present the tidal phenomenon called the
<i>bore</i>, the most celebrated being those of the Brahmaputra, the
Ganges, the Nerbada, and the Indus. The bore is sometimes
many feet in height, and the noise it makes in contending
against the descending stream frightful. The bore which
rushes up the Hughli has a speed of about seventeen or eighteen
miles per hour. A vivid description of the tide or bore of the
Nerbada has been given by the author of the <i>Periplûs</i>. “India,”
he says (c. 45), “has everywhere an abundance of rivers, and her
seas ebb and flow with tides of extraordinary strength, which
increase both at new and full moon, and for three days after
each, but fall off intermediately. About Barygaza (Bharoch) they
are more violent than elsewhere; so that all of a sudden you see
the depths laid bare and portions of the land turned into sea, and
the sea where ships were sailing but just before turned without
warning into dry land. The rivers, again, on the access of flood-tide
rushing into their channels with the whole body of the sea,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
are driven upwards against their natural course for a great many
miles with a force that is irresistible.” In c. 46, after explaining
how dangerous these tides are to ships navigating the Nerbada,
he thus proceeds: “But at new moons, especially when they occur
in conjunction with a night tide, the flood sets in with such extraordinary
violence that on its beginning to advance, even though
the sea be calm, its roar is heard by those living near the river’s
mouth, sounding like the tumult of battle heard in the distance,
and soon after the sea with its hissing waves bursts over the bare
shoals.”</p>

<h4 id="NoteHh"><span class="smcap">Note H<i>h</i>.—Indian Philosophers</span></h4>

<p>Arrian has given the account here promised of the Indian
sages, whom he calls <i>Sophists</i>, in the eleventh chapter of his
<i>Indika</i>. They formed the highest and most honoured of the
seven castes into which, he says, Indian society was divided.
His account is, however, very meagre compared with that which
Strabo, quoting from the same authority, Megasthenes, has given
in the fifteenth book of his <i>Geography</i>. We may subjoin a notice
of the more important points. The philosophers were of two
kinds, the Brachmânes and the Garmanes (Śramanas, i. e. <i>Buddhist
ascetics</i>). The Brachmans were held in greater repute, as they
agreed more exactly in their opinions. They lived in a grove
outside the city, lay upon pallets of straw and on skins, abstained
from animal food and sexual intercourse. After living thirty-seven
years in this manner each individual retired to his own
possessions, led a life of greater freedom, and married as many
wives as he pleased. They discoursed much upon death, which
they held to be for philosophers a birth into a real and happy
life. They maintained that nothing which happens to a man is
bad or good, opinions being merely dreams. On many points
their notions coincided with those of the Greeks. They said, for
instance, that the world was created and liable to destruction,
that it was of a spheroidal figure, and that its Creator governed
it and was diffused through all its parts. They invented fables
also, after the manner of Plato, on the immortality of the soul,
punishments in Hades, and similar topics. Of the Śramanas the
most honourable were the Hylobioi. These, as their name imports,
lived in woods, where they subsisted on leaves and wild
fruits. They were clothed with garments made of the bark of
trees, and abstained from commerce with women and from wine.
The kings held communication with them by messengers, and
through them worshipped the divinity. Next in honour to the
Hylobioi were the physicians, who cured diseases by diet rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
than by medicinal remedies, which were chiefly unguents and
cataplasms. See XV. i. 58-60.</p>

<p>Arrian, in the opening chapters of the seventh book of his
<i>Anabasis</i>, gives an account of Alexander’s dealings with the
Gymnosophists of Taxila which agrees in substance with that
given by Strabo (XV. i. 61-65) based on the authority both of
Aristoboulos and Onesikritos, the latter of whom was sent by
Alexander to converse with the gymnosophists. For the details
see <a href="#BIOGRAPHICAL_APPENDIX">Biog. Appendix</a>, <i>s.v.</i> Kalânos.</p>

<h4 id="NoteIi"><span class="smcap">Note I<i>i</i>.—Suttee</span> (Diod. Note 12).</h4>

<p>But Diodôros, in a subsequent part of his history (xix. 33),
relates that the law had been enacted because of the great prevalence
of the practice of wives poisoning their husbands. In
c. 34 he states that the two widows of Kêteus, an Indian general
who fell in the great battle in Gabienê between Eumenes and
Antigonos, contended for the honour of being burned on the
funeral pile of their husband, and that the younger was selected
for the distinction, because the elder, being at the time with child,
was precluded by law from immolating herself. Strabo says (XV.
i. 62) that Aristoboulos and other writers make mention of Indian
wives burning themselves voluntarily with their husbands.</p>

<p>From this it would appear that this cruel practice, known as
<i>Suttee</i> (Sansk. <i>satî</i>, “a devoted wife”), which was suppressed by
the humanity of the Indian Government in the days of Lord
Bentinck, was one of high antiquity, but Mr. R. C. Dutt, in his
able and learned work on <i>Civilisation in Ancient India</i>, assigns a
much later date to its origin. He says (vol. iii. 199) that the
barbarous rite was introduced centuries after Manu, whose <i>Institutes</i>,
he thinks, were compiled within a century or two before or
after the Christian aera. In a subsequent passage (p. 332) he
states that Suttee was originally a Scythian custom, and was probably
introduced into India by the Scythian invaders who poured
into India in the Buddhist age (from 242 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to 500 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), and
formed ruling Hindu races later on. There can be no doubt that
Suttee was a Scythian practice. Their kings were entombed with
sacrifices both of beasts and of human beings of both sexes, as
we see from what Herodôtos relates in the seventy-first chapter of
his fourth book. Still the statement of Diodôros shows that
several centuries before the Skythian invasions of India took
place Suttee was an established institution among a race of the
purest Aryan descent such as were the Kathaians—a people
whose name shows they were Kshatriyas. The Hindus themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
believe that the custom was of the very highest antiquity,
and that a text of the <i>Rig-veda</i> sanctioned its observance. It
has been discovered, however, that the text in question has been
falsified and mistranslated, and that in point of fact no mention
is found of the custom in Sanskrit literature till the Pauranik
period, the beginning of which Mr. Dutt assigns to the sixth century
of our aera.</p>

<p>The following remarks on the ancient coinage of India are
extracted from two papers contributed by Mr. W. Theobald to
the <i>Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</i>, Nos. III. and IV. of
1890, under the title <i>Notes on some of the Symbols found on the
Punch-marked Coins of Hindustan</i>:—“The punch-marked coins,”
he says, “though presenting neither kings’ names, dates, nor inscriptions
of any sort, are nevertheless very interesting not only from
their being the earliest money coined in India, and of a purely
indigenous character, but from their being stamped with a number
of symbols, some of which we can with the utmost confidence
declare to have originated in distant lands and in the remotest
antiquity. The punch used to produce these coins differed from
the ordinary dies which subsequently came into use in that they
covered only one of the many symbols usually seen on their
pieces. Some of these coins were round and others of a rectangular
form. The great bulk of these coins is silver (but some
copper, and others gold). Some coins are formed of a copper
blank thickly covered with silver before receiving the impression
of the punches, and this contemporary sophistication of the currency
is found to occur subsequently in various Indian coinages,
in the Graeco-Bactrian of the Panjâb, the Hindu kings of Cabul,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
etc.” Mr. Theobald thinks we may regard these pieces as a portion
of those very coins (or identical in all respects) which the
Brahman Chânakya, the adviser of Chandragupta, with the view
of raising resources, converted, by recoining each <i>Kahapana</i> into
eight, and amassed eighty kotis of <i>Kahapanas</i> (or Kârshâpanas).
Mr. Theobald holds that the square coins, both silver and copper,
struck by the Greeks for their Indian possessions belong to no
Greek national type whatever, but are obviously a novelty adopted
in imitation of an indigenous currency already firmly established
in the country. He adduces by way of proof the testimony of
Curtius, where he states that Taxiles offered Alexander eighty
talents of coined silver (<i>signati argenti</i>). What other, he asks,
except these punch-marked coins could these pieces of coined
silver have been? The name, he then adds, by which these
coins are spoken of in the Buddhist <i>Sutras</i> about 200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> was
“purana” = <i>old</i>, whence General Cunningham argues that the word
<i>old</i>, as applied to the indigenous <i>Karsha</i>, was used to distinguish
it from the new and more recent issues of the Greeks. Mr.
Vincent A. Smith writes to the same effect. He considers the
artistic coins to be of Greek origin, but holds that the idea of
coining money, and the simple mechanical processes for rude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
coins, were not borrowed from the Greeks. It is, he thinks,
impossible to prove that any given piece is older than Alexander,
though some primitive coins may be older. The oldest Indian
coins to which a date can be assigned are, in his opinion, those
issued by Sôphytes, the contemporary of Alexander. The
general adoption of Greek, or Graeko-Roman types of coinage,
he assigns to the first century as a result of the Indo-Skythian
invasions. Roman coins, it is well known, are found in all parts
of India. In Indian writings the Roman <i>dênârius</i> appears in the
form <i>dînâra</i>, and the Greek <i>drachmê</i> (which was about equivalent
in value to the <i>denarius</i>) in the form <i>dramma</i>. The subject of
the Indo-Greek coinage is discussed in A. v. Sallet’s <i>Die Nachfolger
Alexanders</i>.</p>

<p id="Abisares"><span class="smcap">Abisares</span> is called by Arrian the King of the Indian Mountaineers,
and may perhaps be not improperly described as the King of
Kâśmîr. His name is derived from that of his kingdom, <i>Abhisâra</i>,
which designated the mountainous country to the east of the
Indus now known as <i>Hazâra</i>, a name in which some traces of
the old seem to survive. After the fall of Mazaga, he sent troops
across the Indus to aid the inhabitants in resisting Alexander.
He sent embassies, however, to the conqueror both before and
after the defeat of Pôros, whom he inclined to succour. Alexander
allowed him to retain his kingdom, and when he died
appointed his son to succeed him, as we learn from Curtius X. i.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aggrammes.</span>—<i>See</i> <a href="#Xandrames">Xandrames</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alketas</span> was the brother of Perdikkas, who, after Alexander’s
death, assumed the regency of the empire. He was the son of
Orontes, a Macedonian of the province of Orestis. He is first
mentioned by Arrian as commander of one of the brigades which
Alexander, towards the close of his Baktrian campaigns, despatched
under Krateros into the country of the Paratakenians, who still
held out against him. He is next mentioned in connection with the
siege of Mazaga and Ora. When Alexander crossed the Hydaspês
to encounter Pôros, Alketas remained behind in the camp with
Krateros. After Alexander’s death Alketas supported the cause
of his brother, and by his orders put to death Kynanê, the half-sister
of Alexander—a cruel act which his own troops resented.
When Perdikkas was murdered in Egypt (321 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) Alketas was
at the time with Eumenes engaged against Krateros. He afterwards,
however, joined his forces to those of Attalos; but being
defeated in Pisidia, he slew himself to avoid falling into the hands
of Antigonos.</p>

Baktria in succession to Artabazos, who resigned the office on the
ground of his advanced age. When Alexander left Baktria to
invade India he left Amyntas in the province with a force of
10,000 foot and 3500 horse.</p>

He wrote an account of this voyage, and a work describing a
coasting voyage to India.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antigenes</span>, an officer who served both under Philip and
Alexander. In 340 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> he lost an eye at the siege of Perinthos.
He was present in the battle with Pôros, and the divisions of the
phalanx which he led on this occasion formed afterwards part of
the large body of troops which Krateros led through the country
of the Arachotians and Zarangians into Karmania. After the
army reached Sousa he was for some time deprived of his command
for having advanced some fraudulent claim. After Alexander’s
death he obtained the satrapy of Sousiana. In the wars
between the generals he sided with Eumenes, whom he aided
with the Argyraspids under his command. When Eumenes was
defeated in 316 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Antigenes fell into the hands of his enemy,
Antigonos, who ordered him to be burned to death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antigonos</span>, called the One-eyed, was a Macedonian of
Elimiôtis, and one of the generals of Alexander, but did not
accompany him into India, as he had been appointed satrap of
Phrygia. In the partition of the empire he received Phrygia,
Lykia, and Pamphylia, and eventually made himself master of
the whole of Asia Minor. He was slain in the battle of Ipsos
301 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> He was the father of Dêmêtrios Poliorkêtês, who

<p><span class="smcap">Antiochos II.</span>, surnamed Theos, succeeded to the throne of
Syria on the death of his father Antiochos I., who was the son of
the famous Seleukos Nikator. During many years of his reign
he was engaged in intermittent hostilities with Ptolemy Philadelphos
the king of Egypt, who wrested from him Phoenicia and
Hollow Syria. His power was further weakened by the revolt of
Arsakês, who established the Parthian empire (in 250 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), and
by the subsequent revolt of Theodotos, who made Baktria an
independent kingdom. He was one of the kings of the West to

Aśôka. His wife Laodikê caused him to be murdered in

<p><span class="smcap">Antipater.</span>—This officer, who had great experience in war

Alexander set out on his Asiatic expedition. Olympias, jealous
of his power, was constantly engaged in intrigues against him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
while she annoyed her son by filling her letters to him with complaints
against his deputy. After the murder of Perdikkas in
Egypt, Antipater succeeded him in the regency of the empire,
and this he held till his death in 320 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aphrikes</span>, called Eryx by Curtius, was the same whom Arrian
designates the <i>brother of Assakênos</i>, the king of Mazaga. He
was put to death by his own followers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apollonios</span>, a native of Tyana in Kappadokia, was born in
the year 4 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> He adopted the Pythagorean system of philosophy,
and submitted himself to its ascetic discipline. He was
credited with the possession of supernatural powers, and parallels
have been drawn between his character and supposed miracles
and those of Christ. He travelled in the East, and is said to
have visited Taxila, the capital of Phraortes, an Indian prince,
where he met Iarchas, the chief of the Brahmans, and disputed
with Indian gymnosophists. About a hundred years after his
death an account of his life was written by Philostratos, which,
notwithstanding that much of it is untrustworthy, is of great value
for the investigation of Indian antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apollophanes</span> was appointed satrap of the Oritians, but was
deposed not long afterwards by Alexander for misgovernment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ariobarzanes</span> was the satrap of Persis. After the defeat of
the Persians near Arbêla, he fled to secure the pass called the
Persian Gates, which lay on the route to Persepolis. Alexander
having gained the heights above his camp, the Persians took to
flight, and Ariobarzanes made his escape with a few horsemen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristoboulos</span> was a native of Kassandreia, a town on the
isthmus which connects the peninsula of Pallênê with the mainland.
He accompanied Alexander in his Asiatic expedition, and
wrote a history of his wars, which was one of the principal sources
used by Arrian in the composition of his <i>Anabasis</i>, and by Plutarch
in his <i>Life of Alexander</i>. Arrian, in the preface to his great work,
thus characterises the two authors whom he mainly followed:
“Different authors have differed in their accounts of Alexander’s
life.... But I consider the narratives of Ptolemy and Aristoboulos
to be more worthy of credit than the rest; Aristoboulos,
because he attended Alexander in his expedition; and Ptolemy,
not only for that reason, but also because he was afterwards himself
a king, and for one in his position to have falsified facts
would have been more disgraceful than for a man of humbler
rank. Both of them, moreover, compiled their histories after
Alexander was dead, when they were neither compelled, nor
tempted by hope of reward, to misrepresent facts, and on this
account they are the more worthy of credit.” Lucian, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
accuses Aristoboulos of having invented marvellous stories
of Alexander’s prowess in battle; but it is thought that in the
anecdote which he relates in this connection he has used by mistake
the name of Aristoboulos for that of Onesikritos. <i>See</i>
Lucian’s <i>How History should be Written</i>, c. 12. It is said that
Aristoboulos began the composition of his history when he was
84 years old, and that he lived to be 90.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristonous</span> was, like Alexander, a native of Pella, and was
one of the seven or eight chief officers who formed his body-guard,
and had at all times access to his presence. According
to Curtius he was one of the men who helped to save Alexander’s
life when he was assailed and wounded by the Mallians in their
chief stronghold. On the death of Alexander he advocated the
claims of Perdikkas to the supremacy. After the fall of Olympias,
to whose cause he had attached himself, he was put to death by
order of her antagonist, Kassander, in the year 316 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristotle</span> was born in 384 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> at Stageira, a seaport town
near the isthmus which connects the peninsula terminating in
Mount Athos with the mainland of Macedonia. When he was
studying philosophy in Athens under Plato he received a letter
from King Philip announcing the birth of his son Alexander. This
letter has been preserved by Aulus Gellius in his <i>Noctes Atticae</i>
(ix. 3):—“Philip to Aristotle greeting: know that a son has been
born to me. I thank the gods, not so much for his birth, as
that it has been his fortune to be born when you are in the prime
of life; for I hope that being instructed and educated by you, he
will prove himself worthy both of us and of the succession to so
great a state.” Thirteen years afterwards Philip summoned the
great philosopher to his court, and entrusted him with the education
of his son, which was conducted in quiet seclusion at Stageira,
at a distance from Pella, the centre of political activity and court
intrigue. Here Alexander remained for four years, at the end of
which he was called to govern the kingdom during his father’s
temporary absence on an expedition against Byzantium. Along
with him were educated other noble youths, Kassander, son of
Antipater; Marsyas of Pella; Kallisthenes, who was related to
Aristotle; Theophrastos, and probably also Nearchos, Ptolemy,
and Harpalos. The course of instruction embraced poetry,
eloquence, and philosophy, and, no doubt, also politics, though
one of the leading aims of Alexander in after life, that of uniting
all the nations under his sway into one kingdom without due
regard to their individual peculiarities, was opposed to the views
of his master. Alexander regarded Aristotle with sentiments
of the deepest respect and affection, and rewarded him for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
instructions with a munificence which has never been surpassed.
Pliny mentions how liberally he supported the philosopher in
his researches into natural science, especially in the department
of zoology, ordering his vicegerents everywhere to supply him
with specimens of all kinds of animals. Unhappily the cordiality
between them was interrupted when Kallisthenes began to express
disapproval of the change in Alexander’s conduct and policy.
Aristotle died at the age of 63, about a year after the death of
his pupil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsakês</span> was the ruler of a small mountain kingdom which
adjoined that of his brother Abisares, King of Kâśmîr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Artabazos</span> was a Persian satrap, who for some years maintained
a war of rebellion against Artaxerxes III. In the reign of
Darius he distinguished himself by his fidelity to his sovereign.
He took part in the battle of Gaugamela, and afterwards accompanied
Darius in his flight. Alexander, who approved of his
fidelity to his master, rewarded him with the satrapy of Baktria.
Ptolemy married one of his daughters and Eumenes another.
He resigned his satrapy on account of his great age, and was
succeeded by Kleitos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Artemidoros</span> was a Greek geographer who lived about 100
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> His work on geography was abridged by Markianos. Some
fragments of the work, which was of high value, and of the
abridgment, have been preserved by Strabo and other writers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Asklêpios</span> (<span class="smcap">Aesculapius</span>) was the god of the medical art. His
descendants were called Asklepiadai, and had their principal
seats at Kôs and Knidos. The Asklepiads were not only a
fraternity of physicians, but an order of priests, who combined
religion with the practice of their art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aśôka</span> was the son of Vindusâra and grandson of Chandragupta,
called Sandrokottos by the Greeks. He ascended the
throne of Magadha in 270 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Having been converted to
Buddhism, he established that faith as the state religion of his vast
empire, which comprised the greater part of India. He was
zealous in promoting the spread of his creed, and even sent
missionaries to expound its doctrines to the sovereigns of the
West, Antiochos of Syria, Ptolemy of Egypt, Antigonos of Macedonia,
Magas of Kyrênê and Alexander of Epiros. His religious
zeal, piety, and benevolence inspire all the many edicts he promulgated,
which are still to be read cut on rocks, caves, and
pillars. The date of his death is uncertain, but is referred to the
year 222 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> His inscriptions are invaluable for the aid they
contribute towards the solution of some of the most important
and difficult problems with which the investigators of Indian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
antiquity have to deal. They throw light on many points of
historical, chronological, and linguistic inquiry, as well as on
others having reference to the social, political, and religious
condition of the Indian people in the days when Buddhism first
rose to the ascendant. An account of these inscriptions will be
found in Lassen’s <i>Alt. Ind.</i> ii. pp. 215-223.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assagetes</span> was, Lassen thinks, an Assakênian chief. His
name probably transliterates <i>Aśvajit</i>; according to the same
authority the word would mean “conquered by the horse.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assakanos</span>, the King of Mazaga, the capital of the Assakênians.
According to Arrian he was slain during the siege of
that stronghold by Alexander, but Curtius leads us to believe that
he had died before the conqueror’s advent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Astes</span>, the chief of Peukelaôtis, submitted to Alexander when
he entered India, but afterwards revolted and was slain by the
troops under Hêphaistiôn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Athênaios</span> was the author of the <i>Deipnosophists</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the
<i>Banquet of the Learned</i>, or, perhaps, the <i>Contrivers of Feasts</i>.
This work is described by a writer in Smith’s <i>Classical Dictionary</i>
as a vast collection of anecdotes, extracts from the writings of
poets, historians, dramatists, philosophers, orators, and physicians,
of facts in natural history, criticisms and discussions on almost
every conceivable subject, especially on gastronomy. It contains
numerous references to Alexander and the events of his time.
Athênaios was a native of Naukratis, in Lower Egypt. He wrote
in the earlier part of the third century of our aera.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Athenodôros</span> was the leader of the sedition of the Greek
colonists settled in Baktria who were anxious to return to their
native country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attalos.</span>—Three persons of this name are mentioned in this
work:</p>

<p>1. <i>Attalos</i>, one of the generals of King Philip, and uncle of
Kleopatra, whom that king married in 337 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> At the nuptial
festivities, Attalos requested the guests to pray to the gods that a
legitimate heir to the throne might be the fruit of the marriage.
This naturally gave great offence to Alexander and his mother,
Olympias, who both in consequence withdrew from the kingdom.
Attalos was in Asia at the time of Philip’s death, and was instigated
by Demosthenes to rebel against his successor. Alexander
then caused him to be assassinated. It will be seen from what
has been stated that the royal house of Macedonia practised
polygamy.</p>

<p>2. <i>Attalos</i>, who commanded the Agrianians in the battles of
Issos and Gaugamela.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span></p>

<p>3. <i>Attalos</i>, the son of Andromenes of Stymphalia, a district in
Macedonia, or on its borders, was one of Alexander’s chief
officers. He was accused, along with his brothers, of complicity
with Philôtas in his alleged conspiracy, but was honourably
acquitted. In 328 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> he was left with other officers to hold
Baktria in subjection, while Alexander himself marched against
the Sogdians. In the campaign of 327 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> against the Assakênians
and other tribes north of the Kabul River, Attalos served
in the division of the army which Alexander commanded in person.
He took part in the great battle in which the Assakênians were
defeated, and in the siege of Ora. He fought also in the battle
against Pôros. His division formed part of the troops which
Krateros led by the route of the Bolan Pass into Karmania.
After Alexander’s death he supported Perdikkas, whose sister he
had married. After the murder of Perdikkas he joined Alketas,
his brother-in-law, but their united forces were defeated by
Antigonos in Pisidia. Alketas was seized and imprisoned. His
ultimate fate is unknown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baitôn</span>, one of the scientific men in Alexander’s army,
employed, like Diognêtos, in measuring the distances traversed
in its marches, whence he was called Alexander’s <i>bêmatistês</i>. He
left a professional work, which, as we learn from Athênaios (x. p.
442) was entitled <i>Stages of Alexander’s Marches</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Balakros.</span>—There were three officers of this name in Alexander’s
army. 1. The son of Nikanor, who was a Somatophylax,
and was appointed satrap of Kilikia after the battle of Issos. He
was slain in Pisidia in Alexander’s lifetime. 2. The son of
Amyntas was commander of the allies in succession to Antigonos,
and commander, along with Peukestas, of the army which Alexander
left in Egypt. 3. A commander of the javelin men who
took part in the great battle with the Aspasians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barsinê</span>, called also Stateira, was the elder daughter of Darius,
and became the wife of Alexander at Sousa, 324 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Within a
year of Alexander’s death she was treacherously murdered by
Roxana.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barzaëntes</span>, satrap of the Arachosians and Drangians, was
one of the murderers of Darius. To escape Alexander he fled to
India, but was given up by the inhabitants to Alexander, who
ordered his death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bêssos</span>, the satrap of Baktria, commanded the left wing of
the Persian army at Arbêla, and was thus directly opposed to
Alexander himself in that battle. After the battle he conspired
against his unfortunate master, who was also his kinsman, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
caused him to be assassinated lest he should fall into Alexander’s
hands—a result which would have frustrated his design of
mounting the vacant throne. He fled across the Oxus, but was
betrayed and delivered up to Alexander, who caused him to be
tried before a council at Zariaspa, and after suffering mutilation
to be executed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chandragupta.</span>—<i>See</i> <a href="#Sandrokottos">Sandrokottos</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charês</span>, or Cares, a native of Mytilênê in Lesbos, was an officer
with Alexander who discharged the functions of court usher. He
wrote a book (now lost) of anecdotes about Alexander’s wars and
private life, which is frequently quoted by Athênaios. Some
fragments have also been preserved by Plutarch, Pliny, and
Aulus Gellius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleophis</span>, Queen of Mazaga, surrendered that city to Alexander,
by whom she was kindly treated, and to whom she is said
to have borne a son who became an Indian king. In Racine’s
tragedy, <i>Alexandre le Grand</i>, Cleophis, who figures as one of the
<i>dramatis personae</i>, is made the sister of Taxilês.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dêimachos</span> or <span class="smcap">Daimachos</span> was ambassador at the court of
Allitrochades, the son and successor of Sandrokottos, and wrote
a work on India in two books. He is pilloried by Strabo as the
most mendacious of all writers about India.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dêmêtrios</span> was one of the officers who formed Alexander’s
bodyguard. He was accused by Philôtas as being one of his
accomplices in the conspiracy against the king’s life, and was in
consequence deprived of his post, to which Ptolemy was then
preferred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dêmêtrios</span>, son of Pythonax, was one of the select band of
cavalry called the <i>Companions</i>. He took part in the Indian
campaigns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dêmêtrios Poliorkêtês</span>, the son of Antigonos, became
king of Macedonia in 294 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dioskorides</span>, the famous writer on <i>Materia Medica</i>, was a
native of Kilikia, and flourished, so far as can be conjectured,
about the beginning of the second century of our aera.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Embisaros.</span>—<i>See</i> <a href="#Abisares">Abisares</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epiktêtos</span>, the famous philosopher, was a native of Hieropolis
in Phrygia, and a freedman of Epaphroditus, the favourite
of Nero. Arrian, who was one of his disciples, composed a short
manual of his philosophy as taken down from his lectures, and
known as the <i>Enchiridion</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eratosthenes</span> was appointed by Ptolemy Euergetes (grandson
of Alexander’s Ptolemy) president of the Alexandrian Library,
an office which he held for upwards of forty years. He may be
considered as the founder of scientific geography, and in some
measure also of systematic chronology. He was born at Kyrênê
in 276 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and educated in Athens, where he devoted himself
to the study of learning and philosophy. He died in Alexandria
in the year 196 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> His works, which were numerous and
treated of a great variety of subjects, scientific and literary, have
perished, with the exception of some fragments cited by other
writers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erigyios</span> was by birth a Mitylenaian, and was an officer in
Alexander’s army. He commanded the cavalry of the allies both
in the battle of Arbêla and when Alexander set out from Ekbatana
in pursuit of Darius. He was slain fighting with Baktrian
fugitives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudêmos.</span>—When Alexander heard in Karmania that Philip,
who had been left in India as satrap, had been treacherously
murdered by the mercenaries, he sent orders to Taxilês and
Eudêmos to administer affairs till a new satrap should be appointed.
Sometime after Alexander’s death Eudêmos decoyed
Pôros into his power and cut him off. He then left India either
because Eumenes requiring his services in contending against
Antigonos recalled him, or because he was unable to hold out
against the native revolt headed by Sandrokottos. The troops
and elephants which he took with him from India were of great
service to Eumenes. After the fall of his chief Eudêmos was
put to death by Antigonos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eumenes</span> was a native of Kardia, a Greek colony situated in
the Thracian Chersonese. He was private secretary to King
Philip, and then to Alexander, whom he attended throughout his
Asiatic expedition. It was one of his duties as royal secretary
to keep a diary (<i>Ephêmerides</i>) in which the transactions of each
day had to be recorded, and this work is quoted both by Arrian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
and Plutarch. He showed himself a man of consummate ability
in the arts both of war and of politics. His alien origin, however,
exposed him to the jealousy of the Macedonian officers.
Hêphaistiôn in particular, Alexander’s chief favourite, sought by
every means to compass his overthrow. Eumenes, however, by his
prudence and tact frustrated all attempts made to undermine his
influence with the king who had a just appreciation of his merits.
Though his labours were chiefly those of the closet, he was sometimes
employed in the field, more especially on occasions of
unusual emergency. When Alexander, on returning to Sousa,
celebrated his own nuptials and those of his companions with
oriental brides, he gave, as Arrian tells us (vi. 4), to Ptolemy, and
Eumenes, the royal secretary, the daughters of Artabazos; to the
former Artikama, and to the latter Artonis. After the king’s
death Eumenes obtained Kappadokia, Paphlagonia, and Pontos,
and after some delay was established in the government of these
provinces. After the death of Perdikkas, to whom he owed this
service, he was requested by Olympias and Polysperchon to
undertake the supreme command throughout Asia on behalf of
the king. He had in consequence to contend against the faction
opposed to the royal family which was headed by Antigonos, and
supported by Ptolemy, Peithôn, Seleukos, and Nearchos. After
coping successfully for a considerable time against this powerful
confederacy, he was delivered up by his own troops to Antigonos,
who, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Nearchos, ordered
him to be put to death, 316 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gorgias</span>, a commander of a division of the phalanx. He
marched with Hêphaistiôn and Perdikkas by the Khaiber Pass to
the Indus, and fought in the battle against Pôros.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harpalos</span> was of princely birth, and nephew of King Philip.
He was educated along with Alexander, whom he accompanied
into Asia in the capacity of superintendent of his treasury.
Having betrayed his trust he fled to Greece, but was recalled by
Alexander, who overlooked his offence and reinstated him in his
office. Alexander, on setting out from Ekbatana to pursue
Darius, left Harpalos in that stronghold in charge of the vast
treasures which had been transported thither from Sousa and
other plundered capitals. Harpalos removed thence to Babylon,
where he ruled as satrap while the king was in India. Here his
licentiousness and extravagance exceeded all bounds. On hearing
that Alexander had returned to Sousa, and was punishing
with the utmost severity all officers who had misgoverned in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
absence, he set out for the coast, taking with him the vast sum
of 5000 talents and a large escort of troops. He crossed over
to Attica, but the Athenians would not permit him to land until
he had disbanded his followers. When he was admitted into
the city he employed his wealth in bribing the orators to gain
over the people to his cause in opposition to Alexander. He
was, however, obliged to take to flight, and having landed with
his treasures in the island of Crete, was there assassinated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hêkataios</span>, one of the earliest and most distinguished
Greek historians and geographers, was a native of Milêtos,
and lived about 520 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> He is the first Greek writer who distinctly
mentions India. Some fragments of his works have been
preserved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hêphaistiôn</span> was a native of Pella, and in his childhood
appears to have been brought up with Alexander, who was of
the same age as he, and not only continued to be his friend
through life, but lavished upon him when removed by death the
most extravagant honours. In the Egyptian expedition he commanded
the fleet, and he distinguished himself in the battle of
Arbêla, where he was wounded in the arm. When Philôtas was
put to death the command of the horse guards was divided between
him and Kleitos. He conducted important operations in
Sogdiana and Baktria, and throughout all the subsequent campaigns
until the army returned to Sousa. He was not possessed
of any striking share of ability, and would certainly not have
risen to eminence through his own unaided exertions. At Sousa
Alexander gave him to wife Drypatis, one of the daughters of
Darius, and the sister of Stateira, whom he himself married.
Hêphaistiôn was soon afterwards cut off by fever at Ekbatana.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herakon</span>, one of Alexander’s officers, was appointed with
two others to command the army in Media on the death of
Parmenion. During Alexander’s absence in the far east he committed
many excesses, for which he was put to death on Alexander’s
return from India.</p>

<p id="Kalanos"><span class="smcap">Kalânos</span> was a gymnosophist of Taxila, who left India with
Alexander, and burned himself alive on a funeral pile at Sousa.
His real name, Plutarch says, was <i>Sphinês</i>; but the Greeks called
him Kalânos, because, in saluting those he met, he used the word
<i>kale!</i> equivalent to <i>hail!</i> The Sanskrit adjective <i>kalyâna</i> means
salutary, lucky, well, etc. If we except Sandrokottos, Taxilês, and
Pôros, there is no other Indian with whose history, opinions, and
personal characteristics the classical writers have made us so well
acquainted as with those of Kalânos. For this reason, as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
as because it falls properly within the scope of my undertaking to
do so, I shall here present translations of all the passages I can
find which relate to him, and to another gymnosophist who was
a man of a very different stamp called <i>Mandanes</i>, and sometimes,
but improperly, <i>Dandamis</i>. Arrian (VII. i. 5—iii.) thus writes:—i. 5.
I commend the Indian sages of whom it is related that certain of
them who had been caught by Alexander walking about according
to their wont in the open meadow, did nothing else in sight of
himself and his army but stamp upon the ground on which
they were stepping. When he asked them through interpreters
what they meant by so doing, they replied thus: O King Alexander,
each man possesses as much of the earth as what we have
stepped on; but you, being a man like the rest of us, except that
you wickedly disturb the peace of the world, have come so far
from home to plague yourself and every one else, and yet ere
long when you die you will possess just so much of the earth as
will suffice to make a grave to cover your bones. ii. Alexander
praised what they had said, but nevertheless continued to act in
opposition to their advice.... When he arrived at Taxila and
saw the Indian gymnosophists, he conceived a great desire that
one of their number should live with him, because he admired
their patience in enduring hardships. But the oldest of the
philosophers, Dandamis by name, with whom the others lived as
disciples, not only refused to go himself, but forbade the others to
go. He is said to have replied that he was also a son of Zeus,
if Alexander was such,<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> and that he wanted nothing that was
Alexander’s; for he was content with what he had, while he saw
that the men with Alexander wandered over sea and land for no
advantage, and were never coming to an end of their wanderings.
He desired, therefore, nothing it was in Alexander’s power to
give: nor did he fear being excluded from anything he possessed;
for while he lived, India would suffice for him, yielding him her
fruits in due season, and when he died he would be delivered
from the body an unsuitable companion. Alexander accordingly
did not attempt to compel him to go with him, considering him
free to please himself. But Megasthenes has stated that Kalânos,
one of the philosophers of this place, was persuaded to go since
he had no power of self-control, as the philosophers themselves
allowed, who upbraided him because he had deserted the happiness
among them, and went to serve another master than the
deity. iii. I have thus written, because in a <i>History of Alexander</i>
it was necessary to speak of Kalânos; for when he was in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
country of Persis he fell into delicate health, though he had never
before had an illness. Accordingly, as he had no wish to lead
the life of an invalid, he informed Alexander that, broken as he
was in health, he thought it best to put an end to himself before
he had experience of any malady that would oblige him to change
his former mode of life. Alexander long and earnestly opposed
his request; but when he saw that he was quite inflexible, and
that if one mode of death was denied him he would find another,
he ordered a funeral pyre to be piled up in accordance with the
man’s own directions, and ordered Ptolemy, the son of Lagos,
one of the bodyguards, to superintend all the arrangements.
Some say that a solemn procession of horses and men advanced
before him, some of the men being armed, while others carried
all kinds of incense for the pyre. Others again say that they
carried gold and silver bowls and royal apparel; also, that a
horse was provided for him because he was unable to walk from
illness. He was, however, unable to mount the horse, and he was
therefore carried on a litter crowned with a garland, after the manner
of the Indians, and singing in the Indian tongue. The Indians
say that what he sang were hymns to the gods and the praises
of his countrymen, and that the horse which he was to have
mounted—a Nêsaian steed of the royal stud—he presented to
Lysimachos who attended him for instruction in philosophy. On
others who attended him he bestowed the bowls and rugs which
Alexander, to honour him, had ordered to be cast into the pyre.
Then mounting the pile, he lay down upon it in a becoming
manner in full view of the whole army. Alexander deemed the
spectacle one which he could not with propriety witness, because
the man to suffer was his friend; but to those who were present
Kalânos caused astonishment in that he did not move any part
of his body in the fire. As soon as the men charged with the
duty set fire to the pile, the trumpets, Nearchos says, sounded by
Alexander’s order, and the whole army raised the war-shout as if
advancing to battle. The elephants also swelled the noise with
their shrill and warlike cry to do honour to Kalânos.</p>

<p>In a subsequent chapter (xviii.) Arrian records the following
story of Kalânos: When he was going to the funeral pyre to die,
he embraced all his other companions, but did not wish to draw
near to Alexander to give him a parting embrace, saying he would
meet him at Babylon and would there embrace him. This
remark attracted no notice at the time; but afterwards, when
Alexander died in Babylon, it came back to the memory of those
who heard it, who then naturally took it to have been a prophecy
of his death. Plutarch, in his <i>Life of Alexander</i>, has another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
notice of Kalânos besides that which the reader will find translated
in chapter 65. In chapter 69 he thus writes: “It was
here (in Persepolis) that Kalânos, on being for a short time
afflicted with colic, desired to have his funeral pile erected. He
was conveyed to it on horseback, and after he had prayed and
sprinkled himself with a libation, and cut off part of his hair to
cast into the fire, he ascended the pile, after taking leave of the
Macedonians, and recommending them to devote that day to
pleasure and hard drinking with the king, whom, said he, I shall
shortly see in Babylon. Upon this he lay down on the pyre and
covered himself up with his robes. When the flames approached
he did not move, but remained in the same posture as when he
lay down until the sacrifice was auspiciously consummated, according
to the custom of the sages of his country. Many years afterwards
another Indian in the presence of Caesar (Augustus) at
Athens did the same thing. His tomb is shown till this day, and
is called the <i>Indian’s tomb</i>.—Alexander, on returning from the
pyre, invited many of his friends and his generals to supper,
where he proposed a drinking-bout, with a crown for the prize.
Promachos, who drank most, reached four measures (14 quarts),
and won the crown, which was worth a talent, but survived only
for three days. The rest of the guests, Charês says, drank to
such excess that forty-one of them died, the weather having
turned excessively cold immediately after the debauch.” The
Indian who burned himself at Athens was called <i>Zarmanochegas</i>,
as we learn from Strabo (XV. i. 73), who states, on the authority
of Nikolaös of Damascus, that he came to Syria in the train of
the ambassadors who were sent to Augustus Caesar by a great
Indian king called Pôros. “These ambassadors,” he says, “were
accompanied by the person who burnt himself to death at Athens.
This is the practice with persons in distress, who seek escape
from existing calamities, and with others in prosperous circumstances,
as was the case with this man. For as everything
hitherto had succeeded with him, he thought it necessary to
depart, lest some unexpected calamity should happen to him by
continuing to live; with a smile, therefore, naked, anointed, and
with the girdle round his waist, he leaped upon the pyre. On
his tomb was this inscription: Zarmanochegas, an Indian, a native
of Bargosa (<i>Barygaza</i>, <i>Baroch</i>), having immortalised himself
according to the custom of his country, here lies.” Lassen takes
the name Zarmanochegas to represent the Sanskrit Śramanachârya,
<i>teacher of the Śramanas</i>, from which it would appear he was a
Buddhist priest. Strabo writes at greater length than our historians
about the gymnosophists. In Book XV. i. 61 we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
the following notices: “Aristoboulos says that he saw at Taxila
two sophists, both Brachmans, of whom the elder had his head
shaved, while the younger wore his hair; disciples attended both.
They spent their time generally in the market-place. They are
honoured as public counsellors, and are free to take away without
charge any article exposed for sale which they may choose. He
who accosts them pours over them oil of jessamine in such
quantities that it runs down from their eyes. They make cakes
of honey and sesamum, of which large quantities are always for
sale, and their food thus costs them nothing. At Alexander’s
table they ate standing, and, to give a sample of their endurance,
withdrew to a spot not far off, where the elder, lying down with
his back to the ground, endured the sun and the rains which had
set in as spring had just begun. The other stood on one leg,
holding up with both his hands a bar of wood 3 cubits long;
one leg being tired he rested his weight on the other, and did
this throughout the day. The younger seemed to have far more
self-command; for though he followed the king a short distance,
he soon returned to his home. The king sent after him, but the
king, he said, should come to him if he wanted anything from
him. The other accompanied the king to the end of his life.
During his stay he changed his dress and altered his mode of
life, saying, when reproached for so doing, that he had completed
the forty years of discipline which he had vowed to observe.
Alexander gave presents to his children. (63) Onesikritos says
that he himself was sent to converse with these sages.... He
found at the distance of twenty stadia from the city fifteen men
standing in different attitudes, sitting or lying down naked, and
continuing in these positions till the evening, when they went back
to the city. What was hardest to bear was the heat of the sun,
which was so powerful that no one else could bear without pain
to walk barefooted on the ground at mid-day. (64) He conversed
with Kalânos, one of these sages, who accompanied the king to
Persia, and burned himself after the custom of his country on a
pile of wood. Onesikritos found him lying upon stones, and
drawing near to address him, informed him that he had been sent
by the king, who had heard the fame of his wisdom. As the
king would require an account of the interview, he was prepared
to listen to his discourse if he did not object to converse with
him. When Kalânos saw the cloak, head-dress, and shoes of his
visitor, he laughed and said: “Formerly there was abundance of
corn and barley in the world, as there is now of dust; fountains
then flowed with water, milk, honey, wine, and oil, but repletion
and luxury made men turn proud and insolent. Zeus, indignant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
at this, destroyed all, and assigned to man a life of toil. When
temperance and other virtues in consequence again appeared,
then good things again abounded. But at present the condition
of mankind tends to satiety and wantonness, and there is cause to
fear lest the existing state of things should disappear.” When he
had finished he proposed to Onesikritos, if he wished to hear his
discourse, to strip off his clothes, to lie down naked beside him
on the same stones, and in that manner to hear what he had to
say. While he was uncertain what to do, Mandanes, the oldest
and wisest of the sages, reproached Kalânos for his insolence—the
very vice which he had been condemning. Mandanes then
called Onesikritos to him, and said, I commend the king, because,
although he governs so vast an empire, he is yet desirous of
acquiring wisdom, for he is the only philosopher in arms that I
ever saw.... (65) “The tendency of his discourse,” he said,
“was this, that the best philosophy was that which liberated the
mind from pleasure and grief; that grief differed from labour, in
that the former was pernicious, the latter friendly, to men; for
that men exercised their bodies with labour to strengthen the
mental powers, whereby they would be able to end dissensions,
and give every one good advice, both to the public and to private
persons; that he should at present advise Taxilês to receive
Alexander as a friend; for by entertaining a person better than
himself he might be improved, while by entertaining a worse he
might influence that person to be good.” After this Mandanes
inquired whether such doctrines were taught among the Greeks.
Onesikritos answered that Pythagoras taught a like doctrine, and
instructed his disciples to abstain from whatever had life; that
Sôkrates and Diogenês, whose discourses he had heard, held the
same views. Mandanes replied, that in other respects he thought
them to be wise; but that they were mistaken in preferring
custom to nature, else they would not be ashamed to go naked
as he did, and to live on frugal fare, for, said he, that is the best
house that requires least repairs. He states further that they
employ themselves much on natural subjects, as forecasting the
future, rain, drought, and diseases. On going into the city they
disperse themselves in the market-places.... Every wealthy
house, even to the women’s apartments, is open to them. When
they enter they converse with the inmates and share their meal.
Disease of the body they regard as very disgraceful, and he who
fears that it will attack him, prepares a pyre and lets the flames
consume him. He anoints himself beforehand, and when he
has placed himself upon the pile orders it to be lighted, and
remains motionless while he is burning. (66) Nearchos gives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
the following account of the sages: The Brachmans engage in
public affairs, and attend the kings as counsellors; the rest are
occupied in the study of nature. Kalânos belonged to the latter
class. Women study philosophy with them, and all lead an
ascetic life.</p>

<p>Athênaios in his <i>Gymnosophists</i> (x. p. 437) quotes, like Plutarch,
from Charês, the account of the drinking bout which
followed the burning of Kalânos. He says that Alexander proposed
the match on account of the bibulous propensities (<i>philoinia</i>)
of the Indians. Other references to Kalânos are to be
found in Ailianos, <i>V. H.</i> ii. 41 and v. 6; Lucian, <i>De M. Pereg.</i>
25; Cicero, <i>Disp. Tusc.</i> ii. 22, and <i>De Divin.</i> i. 23, 30. In the
romance <i>History of Alexander</i>, by the Pseudo-Kallisthenes, six
long chapters of Book iii. (11-17) are full of Kalânos, Mandanes,
and the Brachmans.</p>

<p>St. Ambrose wrote a work, <i>De Bragmanibus</i>, in which the
two gymnosophists are frequently mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kallisthenes</span> was a native of Olynthos. He was brought
up and educated by Aristotle, to whom he was related, and at
whose recommendation he was permitted to accompany Alexander
on his Asiatic expedition. He was deficient in tact and
prudence, and exasperated the king by the freedom with which
he censured him for adopting oriental customs, and especially
for requiring Macedonians to perform the ceremony of adoration.
When the plot of the pages to assassinate Alexander was discovered,
Kallisthenes was charged with being an accessary.
According to Charês he was imprisoned for seven months, and
died in India; while Ptolemy states that he was tortured and
crucified. Besides other works, he wrote an account of Alexander’s
expedition, to which Strabo and Plutarch make a few
references, but it was a work of little if any value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanishka</span>, a great Turanian conqueror, whose empire extended
from Kabul to Agra and Gujrut. He was an ardent

of the Śâkâbda aera.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kleander</span>, one of Alexander’s officers. He was employed
to kill Parmenion, to whom he was next in command at Ekbatana.
He was himself put to death when he joined Alexander in Karmania,
on account of his profligacy and oppression while in
Media.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kleitos</span> was a Macedonian, and brother to Alexander’s nurse.
He saved Alexander’s life at the Granîkos. When the companion
cavalry was divided into two bodies, the command of
one was given to Kleitos and of the other to Hêphaistiôn. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
328 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> he was appointed to succeed Artabazos in the satrapy of
Baktria, but on the eve of his departure to take up this office
he was killed by Alexander in a drunken brawl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Koinos</span> was the son of Polemokrates, and the son-in-law of
Parmenion. He was one of Alexander’s ablest generals, and
greatly distinguished himself on various occasions, and especially
in the battle with Pôros. When Alexander had reached the
Hyphasis and wished to proceed farther and reach the Ganges,
Koinos had the courage to remonstrate, and the king was obliged
to act on his advice. He died soon after of an illness, and was
honoured with a splendid burial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kôphaios.</span>—A chief whose dominions lay to the west of the

<p><span class="smcap">Koragos.</span>—A Macedonian bravo called also Horratas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kosmas Indikopleustes.</span>—An Egyptian monk who flourished
towards the middle of the sixth century of our aera. In early
life he was a merchant, and visited for traffic various countries,
Aethiopia, Syria, Arabia, Persia, India, and many other places of
the East. After he had taken to monastic life he wrote a work
called <i>Christian Topography</i>, which is valuable for the geographical
and historical information it contains. It has some
notices concerning India, especially concerning its Christian
communities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krateros</span>, a Macedonian of Orestis, was one of Alexander’s
most distinguished generals, and next to Hêphaistiôn his greatest
favourite. He was in command of infantry on the left wing at
Issos, and of cavalry on the same wing at Gaugamela. He rose
afterwards to be commander of one of the divisions of the
phalanx. On the day of the battle with Pôros he was left with a
part of the army in the camp, and did not cross the river till
victory had declared for Alexander. He commanded the troops
which were sent back from India by way of the Bolan Pass to
Karmania. At Sousa he married Amastris, the niece of Darius,
after which he led, along with Polysperchon, the discharged
veterans back to Europe. In the division of the empire after
Alexander’s death Greece and Macedonia and other European
provinces fell to the share of Antipater and Krateros, who
divorced Amastris and married Phila, Antipater’s daughter. In
321 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Krateros fell in battle against Eumenes, who honoured
his old comrade in the Indian wars with a magnificent funeral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kyrsilos</span>, a native of Pharsalos, who accompanied Alexander
to Asia and wrote an account of his exploits. He is mentioned
by Strabo (XI. xiv. 12).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonnatos</span>, a native of Pella, was one of Alexander’s most
capable and distinguished officers. At the time of Philip’s death he
occupied one of the highest positions at court, being one of the
select bodyguard called <i>sômatophylakes</i>, but under Alexander he
was at first only an officer of the companion cavalry. After the
battle of Issos he was sent to inform the wife of Darius of her
husband’s safety, and when Arrhybas, one of the bodyguards,
died in Egypt, he was promoted to the vacant post. After this
his name continually occurs among the names of those who were
constantly about the king’s person and stood highest in his confidence.
On several occasions he showed the greatest courage,
and at the siege of the Mallian stronghold he saved, along with
Peukestas, the king’s life. When the army marched back from
India he was left to overawe the Oreitai, and to wait in their
country till Nearchos should reach it with the fleet. He inflicted
a crushing defeat on that people, who had assembled a large
army after Alexander had left their borders. For this and other
services he was rewarded at Sousa with a golden crown. In the
division of the empire he received only the satrapy of the Lesser
Phrygia, a share which by no means satisfied his ambition.
Kleopatra, Alexander’s sister, then offered him her hand on condition
that he should assist her against Antipater, the regent of
Macedonia. He consented, but when he passed over into that
country he was slain in battle against the Greeks, who had revolted
from Antipater, whose dominions he wished to appropriate
in their integrity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysimachos</span> was one of Alexander’s great generals and one of
his select bodyguards. He was born at Pella—the son of a
Thessalian serf who by his flatteries had won the good graces of
King Philip. Great personal strength and undaunted courage
seem to have been the qualities by which Lysimachos gained his
splendid position, for he was seldom entrusted by Alexander with
any separate command of importance. He was present in the
battle with Pôros, and was wounded at the siege of Sangala. In
the division of the empire he obtained Thrace for his share, but
his dominions after the battle of Issos, in which along with
Seleukos, Ptolemy, and Kassander, he defeated Antigonos and
his son Dêmêtrios, embraced for a time all Alexander’s European
possessions, in addition to Asia Minor. His third wife was
Arsinoë, the daughter of Ptolemy, King of Egypt. In 281 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
he was defeated and slain by his old comrade in arms, Seleukos.
He was then eighty years of age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Megasthenês</span>, the ambassador sent by Seleukos Nikator to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
the court of Sandrokottos, and author of a work on India of the
highest value. Though this work is lost, numerous fragments
have been preserved by Strabo, Arrian, Pliny, and many other
writers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mela, Pomponius</span>, the first Roman author known to have
composed a formal work on geography. It is supposed that he
flourished under the Emperor Claudius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meleager</span> was by birth a Macedonian, and served with distinction
in Alexander’s Asiatic campaigns, where he commanded
one of the divisions of the phalanx. He was present in the great
battles of the Granîkos, Issos, Gaugamela, and the Hydaspês.
He was never entrusted, however, with any special or important
command. He was a man of an insolent and factious disposition,
and showed himself to be such in the discussions which
arose between the generals after Alexander’s death concerning
the arrangements which should be made for the government of
the empire. He led for a time the opposition against Perdikkas,
but was afterwards for a short time associated with him in
the regency. Two such colleagues could not long act in harmony.
Perdikkas, who was an adept in the arts of dissimulation,
lulled Meleager into fancied security, devised a cunning scheme
for his overthrow, and having succeeded in this ordered him to
be put to death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Memnôn</span>, the Rhodian, was the brother of Mentor, who stood
high in the favour of Darius, and brother-in-law of Artabazos, the
satrap of Lower Phrygia. On the death of his brother, Memnôn,
who possessed great military skill and experience, succeeded to
his authority, which extended over the coast of Asia Minor. He
was the most formidable opponent Alexander encountered in
Western Asia. Fortunately for him, Memnôn died in 333 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
when preparing to sail for Greece, where the Spartans were ready
to join him and rise against the Macedonians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mousikanos</span> was the ruler of a rich and fertile kingdom which
lay along the banks of the Indus, in Upper Sindh. He submitted
to Alexander without resistance, and was allowed to retain his
sovereignty. The Brahmans, however, prevailed on him to revolt
during Alexander’s absence. He was captured by Peithôn and
crucified by Alexander’s orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nearchos.</span>—Among all the great men associated with Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
no one has left a reputation more noble and unsullied than
that of Nearchos. The long and difficult voyage in unknown seas
which he successfully accomplished ranks as one of the greatest
achievements in the annals of navigation. He was free from the
mad ambition to rule which gave rise to the deadly feuds between
Alexander’s other great generals, and stained the records of their
lives with so many dark crimes. He was a native of Crete, but
settled at Amphipolis, a Macedonian city near the Thracian
border. He held a high position at the court of King Philip,
where he attached himself to the party of the young prince, and
was banished along with Ptolemy, Harpalos, and others, who had
involved themselves in his intrigues. Alexander, on mounting the
throne, recalled his former partisans, and did not neglect their
interests. Nearchos accompanied him into Asia, where he was
appointed governor of Lykia and other provinces south of the
Tauros. This post he continued to hold for five years. He
rejoined Alexander before he left Baktria to invade India, and in
India he was appointed commander of the fleet which was built
on the Hydaspês. He conducted it down that river and the
Akesinês and the Indus to Patala (now Haidarâbâd), a naval
station at the apex of the Indus Delta. He arrived at that place
about the time when the south-west monsoon usually sets in.
Alexander, on returning to Patala from the excursions he made
to the ocean, removed the fleet to Killouta, an island in the
western branch of the Indus, which possessed a commodious
haven. He then set out on his return to Persia, leaving the fleet
with Nearchos, who had relieved Alexander’s mind of a load of
anxiety by voluntarily proffering his services to conduct the expedition
by sea to the head of the Persian Gulf. When we
consider, as Bunbury remarks, the total ignorance of the Greeks
at this time concerning the Indian seas, and the imperfect character
of their navigation, it is impossible not to admire the noble
confidence with which Nearchos ventured to promise that he
would bring the ships in safety to the shores of Persia, “if the sea
were navigable and the thing feasible for mortal man.” Nearchos
wished to defer his departure till the monsoon had quite subsided,
but as he was in danger of being attacked by the natives,
who were no longer overawed by Alexander’s presence, he set sail
on the 21st of September, 325 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> He was forced, however, by
the violence of the weather, when he had reached the mouth of
the Indus, to take refuge in a sheltered bay at a station which he
called Alexander’s Haven, and which is now known as Karâchi,
the great emporium of the trade of the Indus. After a detention
here for twenty-four days, he resumed his voyage on the 23rd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
of October. Coasting the shore of the Arabies for 80 miles,
he reached the mouth of the river Arabis (now the Purali), which
divides the Arabies from the Oreitai. The coast of the latter
people, which was 100 miles in extent, was navigated in eighteen
days. At one of the landing-places the ships were supplied by
Leonnatos with stores of corn, which lasted ten days. The navigation
of the Mekrân coast which succeeded occupied twenty days,
and the distance traversed was 480 miles English, though Nearchos
in his journal has set it down at 10,000 stadia or 1250
miles. The expedition in this part of the voyage suffered great
distress for want of provisions. The coast was barren, and its
savage inhabitants, the Ichthyophagi,<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> had little else to subsist
on than fish, which some of them ate raw.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> The Karmanian
coast, which succeeded, was not so distressingly barren, but was
even, in certain favoured localities, extremely fertile and beautiful.
Its length was 296 miles, and the time taken in its navigation
was nineteen days, some of which, however, were spent at
the mouth of the river Anamis (now the Mînâb), whence Nearchos
made a journey into the interior to apprise Alexander of
the safety of his fleet. The coasts of Persis and Sousis were
navigated in thirty-one days. Nearchos had intended to sail up
the Tigris, but having passed its mouth unawares, continued sailing
westward till he reached Diridôtis (Terêdon), an emporium
in Babylonia on the Pallocopas branch of the Euphrates. He
thence retraced his course to the Tigris, and ascended its stream
till he reached a lake through which at that time it flowed and
which received the river Pasitigris, the Ulaï of Scripture, and now
the Karun. The fleet proceeded up this river till it met the army
near a bridge on the highway from Persis to Sousa. It anchored at
the bridge on the 24th of February, 324 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, so that the whole
voyage was performed in 146 days. Nearchos received appropriate
rewards for the splendid service he had so successfully
performed. Alexander was sending him away on another great
maritime expedition when the illness which carried off the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
conqueror broke up the enterprise. In the discussions which
followed regarding the succession to the throne, Nearchos unsuccessfully
advocated the claims of Heraklês, the son of Alexander
by Barsinê, who was the daughter of Artabazos and the
widow of Memnôn the Rhodian. He acquiesced, however, in
the arrangements made by the other generals, and was content
with receiving his former government, even though he was to
hold it subject to the authority of Antigonos. He accompanied
his superior when he marched against Eumenes, and interceded
for the life of the latter when he fell into the hands of his
enemies. Nothing is known of his history after the year 314
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when he was selected by Antigonos to assist his son Dêmêtrios
with his counsels when left for the first time in command
of an army.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nikanor</span>, the son of Parmenion, was commander of the hypaspists
or footguards in the Asiatic expedition. He was present
in the three great battles against the troops of Darius, and died
of disease before the charge of conspiracy was preferred against
his brother Philôtas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olympias</span>, the mother of Alexander, was a passionate, ambitious,
and intriguing woman. She was put to death by order of
Kassander, the son of the regent Antipater, in 316 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, thus
surviving her son seven years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Onesikritos</span> was a Greek historical writer who accompanied
Alexander on his Asiatic expedition. He professed the philosophy
of Diogenes the Cynic, and on this account was sent by Alexander
to converse with the gymnosophists of Taxila. He was the pilot
of Alexander’s ship and of the fleet in sailing down the Indus,
and afterwards during the voyage to the head of the Persian Gulf.
The history written by Onesikritos, which embraced the whole
life of Alexander, fell into discredit owing to the manner in which
he intermingled fact with fiction. His work was, however, too
much undervalued. He was the first author who mentions the
island of Taprobanê (Ceylon). In his later years he attached
himself to the fortunes of Lysimachos of Thrace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orosius</span> was a Spanish ecclesiastic of the fifth century, who
wrote a history of the world from the creation down to the year
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 417.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oxyartes</span>, a Baktrian, the father of Alexander’s queen
Roxana, was one of the chiefs who accompanied Bessos on his
retreat across the Oxus into Sogdiana. Alexander, after marrying
his daughter, appointed him satrap of the land of the Paropamisidai,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
and his successors allowed him to retain that government.
It is not known how long he lived, but it is supposed
that he was dead when Seleukos undertook his Indian expedition,
as his dominions were among those which were surrendered to
Sandrokottos.</p>

<p id="Oxykanos"><span class="smcap">Oxykanos</span>, called Portikanos by Strabo and Diodôros, ruled

<p><span class="smcap">Panini</span>, the celebrated Indian grammarian, was a native of
Salâtura, in Gandhâra. His date is generally referred to the
fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, but this is still a matter of controversy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parmênion</span> was the most experienced and most trusted general
who accompanied Alexander into Asia. He commanded the
left wing of the Macedonian army in the three great battles
against Darius. He was left in command in Media, and so did
not accompany the expedition into India. His assassination has
left an indelible stain on Alexander’s character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patroklês</span> was a general who held under Seleukos and
Antiochos an important government over some eastern provinces
of the Syrian empire. He collected much valuable information
regarding the little-known parts which adjoined his province.
His work, embodying this information, is frequently quoted by
Strabo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pausanias</span> was the author of an <i>Itinerary of Greece</i>, full of

Krateuas, who, like Ptolemy, was a native of Eördaia, and a
member of the select bodyguard; third, Peithôn, the son of
Agênôr, who, like the preceding, rendered distinguished services
in the Indian campaigns. The historians have recorded nothing
of their previous achievements, and when they come to mention
those performed in India, do not always make it clear to which
of the two they mean to ascribe them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peithôn</span>, the son of Krateuas, after Alexander’s death proposed
that Perdikkas and Leonnatos should be appointed joint
regents of the empire, and for this service was rewarded with the
satrapy of Media. After the assassination of Perdikkas he was
himself, through the influence of Ptolemy, raised to the regency
in conjunction with Arrhidaios, but was soon compelled to resign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
and retire to his Median government. He assisted Antigonos to
overthrow Eumenes; but Antigonos, having subsequently suspected
him of entertaining treasonable designs, brought him to
trial before a council, and ordered him to be put to death in
316 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peithôn</span>, the son of Agênôr, took an active part in the wars
against the Malloi and Mousikanos while holding the command
of one of the divisions of the footguards. He was appointed
satrap of Sindh from the great confluence downward to the sea-coast,
and was left behind in his province when Alexander took
his departure from India. After the death of Alexander he was
confirmed in his government, but, it would appear, was ousted
from it by Pôros. After the fall of Eumenes he received from
Antigonos, whose side he had favoured, the satrapy of Babylon.
While serving with Dêmêtrios, the son of Antigonos, he was slain
in the battle of Gaza, in which the young prince rashly and against
his advice engaged Ptolemy. This battle was fought in 312 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perdikkas</span>—one of Alexander’s greatest generals—was a
native of the Macedonian province of Orestis, and descended,
according to Curtius, from a royal house. Under Philip he held
one of the highest offices at court, being a sômatophylax, and
under Alexander he held the same position along with the command
of a division of the phalanx, but afterwards of a division of
the companion cavalry. He distinguished himself at the siege
of Thebes, where he was severely wounded, and in the three
great battles against the armies of Darius. In the Persian,
Sogdian, and Indian campaigns he was frequently entrusted with
separate commands of great importance, and at Sousa was rewarded
for his services with a crown of gold and with the hand
of the daughter of the Median satrap. He was present with
Alexander during his fatal illness; and it is said that the king
when expiring took off the royal signet-ring from his finger and
gave it to him, as if to indicate him as his successor. In the
deliberations which followed to settle the succession, Perdikkas
took a prominent part, and, with the consent of most of the other
generals, was appointed to act as regent of the empire on behalf
of Roxana’s yet unborn child, which, it was hoped, might prove
to be a son. His selfish ambition, however, and acts of cruelty
soon created violent discontent, and a combination was formed
against him by Antigonos, whom he attempted to bring to trial
for misgovernment, but who effected his escape to Macedonia,
and persuaded Antipater, Krateros, and Ptolemy to take up arms
on his behalf. He was slain by his own troops in Egypt, whither
he had proceeded in the hope of being able to crush Ptolemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
before taking measures against the other confederates. Perdikkas was
crafty, cruel, and arrogant, without magnanimity, and, indeed, without
any virtue except personal courage and capacity as a general.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peukestas</span>, a native of Mieza in Macedonia, was one of
Alexander’s great officers, and had the honour of carrying before
him in battle the sacred shield taken down from the temple of
Athêna at Ilion. He is first mentioned as one of the officers
appointed to command a trireme on the Hydaspês. He had a
chief share in saving Alexander’s life in the citadel of the Mallian
capital, and for this service was rewarded by being appointed
a <i>sômatophylax</i> and afterwards satrap of Persia. After being
presented at Sousa with a golden crown, he proceeded to take
possession of his government, when he adopted the Persian dress
and Persian customs, thus pleasing his subjects as well as Alexander
himself. He was in attendance on the king during his
last illness, but does not appear to have taken any leading part
in the discussions held after his death regarding the succession.
He was, however, permitted to retain his government. He took
an active part in the war conducted by Eumenes against Antigonos.
He was vain and fond of display, and his treachery
towards Eumenes, whom he helped to betray into the hands of
his enemies, has left a dark stain on his character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phegelas</span>, or, as he is called by Diodôros, Phêgeus, was
chief of a territory which lay between the Hydraôtes and the
Hyphasis. With regard to the name, M. Sylvain Lévi gives preference
to the form <i>Phegelas</i>, and states his reason thus: “The
<i>e</i> answers to the <i>a</i> of Sanskrit, the <i>g</i> to the <i>g</i> or to the <i>j</i>. <i>Phegeus</i>
does not border on a known form; Phegelas, on the contrary,
answers directly to the Sanskrit <i>Bhagala</i>—the name of a royal
race of Kshatriyas which the Gana-pâtha classes under the rubric
Bâhu, etc., with the name even of Taxilês, Âmbhi.” (<i>Journal
Asiatique</i> for 1890, p. 239.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philippos</span>, the son of Machatas, was one of Alexander’s
officers. In 327 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> he was appointed satrap of India. After
Alexander left India he was assassinated in a conspiracy formed
against him by the mercenaries under his command.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phrataphernes</span> was, under Darius, governor of Parthia and
Hyrkania. He accompanied that sovereign in his flight from
Arbêla, but after his death submitted to Alexander, who reinstated
him in his satrapy. He joined Alexander in India after Pôros
had been defeated, but seems to have soon afterwards returned
to his satrapy, whence he sent supplies to the Macedonian army
when pursuing its distressing march through Gedrôsia. The
successors of Alexander allowed him to retain his satrapy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polyainos</span>, a Macedonian, who flourished about the middle
of the second century of our aera, and was the author of a work on
the stratagems of war, which is still extant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polykleitos</span> was a native of Larissa, who wrote a history of
Alexander. Most of the extracts preserved from this work refer
to the geography of the countries which Alexander conquered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polysperchon</span>, or <span class="smcap">Polyperchon</span>, was one of the oldest officers
of a high rank in Alexander’s service. After the battle of
Issos he was promoted to the command of a division of the
phalanx in succession to Ptolemy, the son of Seleukos, who fell
in that battle. In Baktria he offended Alexander by casting
ridicule on the ceremony of prostration, and was thus for a time
in disgrace. He was present at the passage of the Hydaspês,
and also in the descent of the Indus, and was then sent with
Krateros to conduct the veterans from India to Karmania by
way of the Bolan Pass. He was not in Babylon at the time of
Alexander’s death, and hence was passed over in the allotment
of the provinces made after that event. When war, however,
broke out between Antipater and Perdikkas, the former committed
to his hands the chief command in Macedonia and Greece during
his absence in Asia. The veteran general showed himself worthy
of the trust reposed in him, and received the reward of his
services at Antipater’s death, who appointed him, in preference
to his own son, Kassander, to be his successor in the regency.
After many vicissitudes of fortune, and disgracing his name by
his treachery towards Phôkiôn, and his causing Heraklês, the son
of Alexander, whose cause he had espoused, to be murdered, he
disappears from history after the year 303 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pôros</span> was the most powerful king in the Panjâb at the time
of Alexander’s invasion. He was then at enmity with Omphis,
the king of Taxila, but in alliance with Abisarês, the king of
Kâśmîr. After his defeat and submission to the conqueror, he
was confirmed in his kingdom, the limits of which were afterwards
considerably extended. All that is known of his history
will be found in the translations, if read along with the notice
below, of Sandrokottos, except that after Alexander’s death he
made himself master of Sindh, from which he ousted Peithôn.
The name of Pôros, which is formed from <i>Paura</i> or <i>Paurava</i>,
with the Greek termination <i>os</i> added, shows that he belonged to
a family of the Lunar race. Bohlen, however, takes the name to
be a corruption of the Sanskrit <i>Paurusha</i>, which means “heroic.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Portikanos.</span>—<i>See</i> <a href="#Oxykanos">Oxykanos</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ptolemy</span>, called the son of Lagos, is supposed to have been
in reality the son of Philip, as his mother Arsinoê was the concubine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
of that king, and was pregnant when married to Lagos.
Of all Alexander’s generals Ptolemy was the one who approached
him nearest in a capacity both for war and government, while he
did not fall short of him in magnanimity of disposition. He was
banished from Macedonia by Philip, who discovered that he was
promoting with others a marriage between Alexander and the
daughter of Pixodaros, the king of Karia. He rendered important
services in the war against Darius; and when Dêmêtrios,
a member of the select bodyguard, was arrested on suspicion of
being concerned in the conspiracy of Philôtas, Ptolemy was promoted
to fill his place. It was he who obtained information of
the plot of Hermolaos, and by revealing it was probably the
means of saving the king’s life. In the battle with the Aspasians,
Ptolemy slew their leader with his own hand, and in the campaigns
in India he was on several occasions entrusted with separate
commands of great importance. The story of Alexander’s dream,
which led to the discovery of a plant by which Ptolemy was
cured of a dangerous wound inflicted by a poisoned arrow, must
be apocryphal, since Arrian, who had Ptolemy’s own memoirs of
the expedition constantly before him, is silent on the subject. At
Sousa he received in marriage a daughter of Artabazos. After
Alexander’s death he obtained Egypt as his share of the empire,
and raised that country to a high pitch of prosperity. He reigned
for no less than forty years. The dynasty which he founded,
after subsisting for nearly two hundred years, ended with the
death of Kleopatra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ptolemy III.</span> ascended the throne of Egypt in 247 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> in
succession to his father Ptolemy Philadelphos. In the early part
of his reign he overran Syria, and having thence turned his arms
eastward, advanced as far as Babylon and Sousa, and received
the submission of all the upper provinces of Asia as far as the
borders of Baktria and India. On returning to his kingdom he
carried back with him the statues of the Egyptian deities which
Kambyses had removed to the East, and restored them to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
proper temples, an act which won for him the gratitude of the
Egyptians and the title by which he is generally known, Euergetês,
<i>i.e.</i> Benefactor. Like his father he distinguished himself by his
munificent patronage of literature and science. He was one of
the kings to whom Buddhist missionaries were sent by the
Indian king Aśôka. He died in the year 222 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ptolemy Physkon</span>, king of Egypt, succeeded his brother
Ptolemy VI., surnamed Philomêter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rôxana</span>, the daughter of the Baktrian chief Oxyartes, was
considered by the Macedonians the most beautiful woman in
Asia, next to the wife of Darius. Alexander, who found her
charms irresistible, made her his wife, and she bore him a posthumous
son, called Alexander Aigos, who was admitted to a share
of the sovereignty under the regency of Perdikkas. Before his
birth she had enticed Alexander’s other widow, Barsinê or Stateira,
to Babylon, and caused her to be murdered. She subsequently
fell, with her son, into the power of Kassander, who placed them
both in Amphipolis, where in 311 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> they were both murdered
by their keeper, Glaukias.</p>

<p id="Sambus"><span class="smcap">Sambus</span> was the satrap of a mountainous country adjoining
the kingdom of Mousikanos, with whom he was at feud. His
capital, called Sindimana, has been identified with Sehwân, a city
on the Indus, for which see <a href="#NoteS">Note S</a>. Sambus fled on Alexander’s
approach, not to evade submission, but because he learned that
his enemy, Mousikanos, had been received into the conqueror’s
favour.</p>

<p id="Sandrokottos"><span class="smcap">Sandrokottos</span> (<span class="smcap">Chandragupta</span>).—Sandrokottos, with the exception
perhaps of his grandson, Aśôka, was the greatest ruler
ancient India produced. Though of humble origin, he overthrew
the Macedonian power in the Panjâb, conquered the kingdom of
Magadha, and founded a wide empire such as no Indian king had
before possessed. He is also memorable on another account.
Those learned men who about a century ago took up the study of
Sanskrit, established his identity with the Chandragupta who is
mentioned in the Buddhist Chronicle of Ceylon as the founder of
the Mauryan dynasty of Magadha, and by fixing the date of his
accession to the throne of that kingdom, supplied the chronology
of ancient India with its first properly-ascertained aera, and thus
brought it into line with the chronology of general history.</p>

<p>Besides the notices of this great sovereign in the writings we
have translated, the following occur elsewhere in the classics:—Appian
(<i>Syriakê</i>, c. 55), speaking of Seleukos, says: “And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
having crossed the Indus, he warred with Androkottos, the king
of the Indians, who dwelt about that river, until he entered into
an alliance and a marriage affinity with him.” Strabo (II. i. 9)
says: “Both of these men were sent to Palimbothra, Megasthenes
to Sandrokottos, and Dêimachos to Allitrochades, his son,” and
in XV. i. 36 repeats the statement as concerns Megasthenes. In
XV. i. 53 we read: “Megasthenes, who was in the camp of
Sandrokottos, which consisted of 400,000 men, did not witness
on any day thefts reported which exceeded the sum of 200
drachmai, and this among a people who have no written laws,
who are ignorant even of writing, and regulate everything by
memory.” Lastly, in XV. i. 57 we read: “Similar to this is the
account of the Enotokoitai, of the wild men, and of other
monsters. The wild men could not be brought to Sandrokottos,
for they died by abstaining from food.” Arrian in his <i>Indika</i>
(c. 5) says: “But even Megasthenes, as far as appears, did not
travel over much of India, though no doubt he saw more of it
than those who came with Alexander, the son of Philip, for, as
he says, he had interviews with Sandrokottos, the greatest king of
the Indians, and with Pôros, who was still greater than he.”<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
Lastly, Athênaios mentions him in his <i>Deipnosophists</i> (c. 18 d):
“Phylarchos says that among the presents which Sandrokoptos,
the king of the Indians, sent to Seleukos were certain powerful
aphrodisiacs.” It will be observed that Athênaios transcribes the
name of the Indian king more correctly than any of the other
authors.</p>

<p>These detached notices, combined with those which appear
in the translations, we may now gather together into a connected
and consistent narrative. Sandrokottos was of obscure
birth, and, from the remark of Plutarch that in his early years he
had seen Alexander, we may infer that he was a native of the
Panjâb. It was at one time thought that he had in some way
offended the conqueror, and that to escape the effects of his displeasure,
he had fled for protection to the court of Magadha.
But this belief must now be given up, as it was based on a
corrupt passage in Justin, which, by the restoration of the correct
reading, shows that it was not Alexander whom he had offended,
but Nandrus or Xandrames, the Magadha king. We do not
know what induced Sandrokottos to leave his home and take
service under the latter monarch, but we incline to attribute it to
a sentiment of patriotism forbidding him to seek office or advancement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
under a power which had crushed the liberties of his
country. What the nature of his offence against Nandrus was
does not appear, but he so dreaded his resentment that he quitted
his dominions and returned home to the Panjâb. He found it,
although Alexander had now been six years dead, still under
Greek vassalage, and ruled as formerly in civil matters by Omphis
of Taxila and the great Pôros, while the military administration
had passed into the hands of Eudêmos. Soon after his arrival,
however, the order of things was violently disturbed. Eudêmos
having decoyed Pôros into his power, treacherously murdered
him,<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> but had no sooner done so than he was recalled to the
west to succour Eumenes in his war against Antigonos. As he
took with him 3000 foot, 500 horse, and 125 elephants, he denuded
the province of the main strength of the force by which it
was held in subjection, and his departure was fatal to Greek
power. The Indians, who longed for freedom, and were no
doubt greatly incensed by the murder of Pôros, rose in revolt.
Sandrokottos, who headed this movement, having collected a
band of insurgents, overthrew the existing government, expelled
the remainder of the Greek garrison, and finally installed himself
in the sovereignty of the Panjâb and of all the lower valley of the
Indus. The insurgents, whom he led to victory, are called by
Justin <i>robbers</i>; but we must not thence infer that he was a bandit
leader, who, by taking advantage of an opportune crisis, rose to
power by the help of desperadoes whose crimes had banished
them from society. His adherents were, in point of fact, chiefly
the <i>Arattâ</i> of the Panjâb, who were always called <i>robbers</i>, and are
denounced as such in the <i>Mahâbhârata</i>. The Kathaians, who
so stoutly resisted Alexander at Sangala, were included under this
designation, which means <i>Kingless</i>, and implies that they lived
under republican institutions. The stories told by the same
author of the lion which licked the sweat from Sandrokottos when
asleep, and of the elephant which volunteered to carry him into
battle, and thus gave presages of his future greatness, reflect the
true spirit of oriental romance, and were no doubt derived from
native traditions which somehow found their way to the west.
They remind one of Joseph’s dreams, in which he saw the sheaves
and then the heavenly bodies falling down in obeisance before
him.</p>

<p>Sandrokottos while in Magadha had seen that the king was
held in such odium and contempt by his subjects that, as Plutarch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
tells us, he used often afterwards to speak of the ease with which
Alexander might have possessed himself of the whole country. He
accordingly had no sooner settled the affairs of the Panjâb than
he prepared to invade the dominions of his former master. The
success which he anticipated followed his arms. He overthrew
with ease the unpopular despot, and having received the submission
of Magadha, extended his conquests far beyond its eastern
limits. He was thus able to combine into one great empire the
regions both of the Indus and the Ganges. He established the
seat of government at Palibothra, the capital of Magadha, a great
city advantageously situated at the confluence of the Erannoboas or
Sôn with the Ganges, and on the site now occupied by Pâtnâ,
beneath which, at a depth of from 12 to 15 feet, its ruins lie
entombed.</p>

<p>While Sandrokottos was thus, with a genius like that of Akbar,
welding the states of India into unity, the successors of Alexander
were too much engrossed with their internecine wars to concern
themselves with his doings; but when they had for a time composed
their differences, Seleukos Nikator, the king of Syria,
advanced eastward to recover the Indian conquests of Alexander.
The date of this expedition cannot be fixed with precision, but it
was probably made in the year 305 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, or about ten years after
Sandrokottos had ascended the throne of Palibothra. The
records of it are unfortunately lost. It seems that he was allowed
to cross the Indus without opposition, but it is not known how
far he advanced into the country. We do not even know whether
the hostile armies came into actual conflict, but we may conjecture
that the sight of the vast and formidable host brought
into the field by his antagonist, who was an experienced commander
of the stamp of Pôros, led him to think discretion would
be the better part of valour, and to prefer entering into negotiations
rather than to risk the chance of defeat. At all events
he concluded a treaty by which he not only resigned his claims
to the Greek conquests beyond the Indus, but ceded to the
Indian king considerable districts extending westward from that
river to the southern slopes of the Hindu-Kush. The compact
was cemented by a matrimonial alliance, the Syrian king
giving his daughter in marriage to Sandrokottos. Friendly
relations seem to have subsisted ever afterwards between the two
sovereigns.</p>

<p>Seleukos sent as his ambassador to the Indian court his friend
and companion Megasthenes. This was a fortunate choice,
for while there Megasthenes, who was an acute observer and of
an inquisitive turn of mind, composed a work on India, in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
he gave a faithful account of what fell under his own observation,
as well as of what facts he could gather from trustworthy reports.
That work, now lost, was the source whence Strabo and other
classical authors derived most of their information regarding
India. In such of the fragments thus preserved as relate to
Sandrokottos, we find an admirable picture of his system of
government, of his personal habits, and of the regulations of his
court. He did not live to old age, but died in 291 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, before
he had reached his fifty-fifth year.</p>

<p>When we turn to the Buddhist accounts of Chandragupta we
find them tally so closely in all main points with the Greek
accounts of Sandrokottos that no doubt can be left that the two
names which are so nearly similar denote but one and the same
person. As he was the founder of the dynasty to which the
pious Aśôka, the Constantine of the Buddhist faith, belonged,
the Buddhist writers assign to him an honourable pedigree which
connected him even with the royal house whence Buddha himself
sprang. His father, they tell us, reigned over a small kingdom
situated in a valley among the Himalayas, and called
Maurya, from the great number of its peacocks (<i>Mayûra</i>). He
was killed in resisting an invasion of his enemies, but his queen
escaped to Pataliputra, where she gave birth to a son whom she
exposed in the neighbourhood of a cattle shed. The child, like
Oedipûs, was found by a shepherd, who called him <i>Chandragupta</i>
(<i>Moon protected</i>), and charged himself with his maintenance.
There resided at that time in Pataliputra a Brahman who had
come from the great city of Taxila in the Panjâb, and whose name
was Chânakya. To him King Dhanananda had given an insult
which could be expiated by nothing short of his destruction.
While the Brahman was casting about for means whereby he
could clear his score with the offender, Chandragupta, now a boy,
fell under his cognisance. Having discovered that he was of
royal descent, and foreseen from his conduct among his companions
that in after life he would be capable of great achievements,
he bought him from the shepherd and gave him a training
adapted to make him a fit instrument for the execution of his
designs. When Chandragupta had grown up, his master put
under his command a body of troops kept secretly in his pay, and
attempted a rebellion, which proved abortive. Chandragupta fled
to the desert, but having ere long collected a fresh force he
invaded Magadha from the border, that is, from the side of the
Panjâb. He captured city after city till the capital itself fell into
his hands. The king was slain, and Chandragupta ascended the
vacant throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span></p>

<p>Another form of the native tradition assigns his paternity to
Dhanananda (the last of the eight Nanda kings, who ruled in
succession over Magadha), though not by his queen, but by a
woman of low caste—a sudra called Mura. The Brahmans
made this base-born scion of the royal house the instrument of
their rebellious designs, and with the help of a northern prince,
to whom they offered an accession of territory, raised him to the
throne while he was yet a youth, and put Nanda and his eight
sons to death. They did not make good their promise to their
ally, but rid themselves of him by assassination. His son Malayaketu
marched with a large army, in which were Yavanas (Greeks),
to revenge his death, but returned without success to his country.
It has been supposed that this expedition may have been the
same as that of Seleukos.</p>

<p>The Nanda dynasty which was supplanted by the Mauryan
in 315 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> had succeeded to that of Sisunâga in 370 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Its
last member, whom the Greeks call <i>Xandrames</i> and Curtius
<i>Agrammes</i>, is variously named in native writings <i>Dhanananda</i>,
<i>Nanda Mahâpadma</i>, and <i>Hiranyagupta</i>. Xandramas (of which
Agrammes seems to be a distorted form) transliterates the Sanskrit
<i>Chandramas</i>, which means <i>Moon-god</i>. A Hindu play—the
Mudrâ Râkshasa—produced early in the Mahommedan period
refers to the revolution by which Chânakya raised Chandragupta
to power, but is of no historical value. Chandragupta was succeeded
by his son Vindusâra, who is called by Strabo <i>Allitrochades</i>,
and by Athênaios (xiv. 67),<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> <i>Amitrochates</i>, a form which transliterates
the Sanskrit <i>Amitraghâta</i>, a title by which he was
frequently designated, and which means <i>enemy-slayer</i>. He was
succeeded by his son Aśôka in 270 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seleukos Nikator</span>, one of Alexander’s great generals who
made himself king of Syria, was the son of Antiochos, an
officer of high rank in the service of King Philip. Seleukos was
distinguished for his great personal strength and courage, and
when he accompanied Alexander into Asia held a command in
the companion cavalry. He crossed the Hydaspês with Alexander
himself, and took an important part in the great battle
which followed. At Sousa he was rewarded for his eminent services
with the hand of Apama, an Asiatic princess, the daughter of
Spitamenes. In the dissensions which broke out after Alexander’s
death among his generals, Seleukos sided with Perdikkas and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
the cavalry against Meleager and the infantry, and was in consequence
made Chiliarch of the companions, one of the highest
offices, and one which Perdikkas himself had previously held.
He accompanied Perdikkas into Egypt, but he there put himself
at the head of the mutineers by whom his patron was assassinated.
At the second partition of the provinces made at Triparadeisos
321 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> he obtained the Babylonian satrapy, and established
himself in Babylon. He assisted Antigonos in the war against
Eumenes, but afterwards contended against him in alliance with
Ptolemy. During an interval when hostilities were suspended
between himself and his rivals, Seleukos undertook an expedition
into India to regain the conquests of Alexander over which Sandrokottos
had established his authority. We do not know how
far he advanced into India, but he probably again crossed the
Hydaspês, which he had crossed twenty years before along with
the great conqueror himself. The result of the expedition was a
treaty by which Seleukos ceded to Sandrokottos his Indian provinces
and the regions west of the Indus as far as the range of
Paropanisos, in exchange for 500 elephants, and a marriage
alliance by which the daughter of Seleukos became the bride of
the Indian king. Immediately either before or after this expedition,
Seleukos in 306 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, following the examples of Antigonos
and Ptolemy, formally assumed the regal title and diadem. In
the battle of Ipsos 301 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, where Seleukos, in league with
Ptolemy, Lysimachos, and Kassander, fought against Antigonos,
the cavalry and elephants which the Syrian king brought into the
field were mainly instrumental in securing the victory. The
empire of Seleukos then became the most extensive of those
which had been formed out of Alexander’s conquests, extending
from Phoenicia to Baktria and Sogdiana. After being engaged in
other wars, Seleukos crossed the Hellespont with an army with a
view to seize the crown of Macedonia, but was assassinated at
Lysimachia by Ptolemy Keraunos in the beginning of the year
280 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> in the thirty-second year of his reign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sisikottos</span> was an Indian who had deserted his countrymen
and taken service under Bessos. After the conquest of Baktria
he took service under Alexander, who, no doubt, obtained from
him much valuable information regarding India and its affairs.
After the capture of the rock Aornos, Sisikottos was left in command
of the garrison which Alexander established there. He
afterwards sent messengers to inform Alexander that the Assakênians
had revolted from him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sitalkes</span> was a leader of Thracian light-armed troops in
Alexander’s service. He was left under Parmenion in Media,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
and on Alexander’s return from India was put to death for
misgovernment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solinus</span> was the author of a compendium of geography
extracted mostly from the <i>Natural History</i> of Pliny. He lived
about the middle of the third century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sôpheites</span> or <span class="smcap">Sôpeithês</span> was, according to Curtius and
Diodôros, king of a territory situated to the west of the Hyphasis.
According to Arrian his dominions (or those of a king of the
same name) lay along the banks of the Hydaspês, and, as we
learn from Strabo, embraced the salt range of mountains called
<i>Oromenus</i> by Pliny. With regard to the name, Lassen took it
to represent the Sanskrit <i>Aśvapati</i>, “lord of horses.” M. Sylvain
Lévi, however, thinks this a fanciful identification of the two
names, erring against Greek and against Sanskrit. He then says:
“A drachma of Indian silver coined towards the end of the fourth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> in imitation of Greek money bears the inscription
ΣΩΦΥΤΟΥ. The form Sophytes is, then, the only one to be
considered. The laws of transcription established by numerous
examples give the equivalents: ω = <i>ô</i> or <i>aw</i>, φ = <i>bh</i>. Sophytes
then leads back to Sobûtha or Saubh. The Gana-pâtha knows
precisely a country of the name of Saubhûta. Pânini (IV. ii. 67
<i>sqq.</i>) shows by examples how local names are formed.... The
name of Sâmkala, etc., is formed in this way. M. Bhandarkar
has already recognised in the city of Sâmkala the famous fortress
of Sangala, ... but the Indian <i>savant</i> has not overcome the
old prejudice which, regardless of the laws of transcription,
identifies Sangala with Śâkala, capital of the Madras (Lassen,
<i>Ind. Alt.</i> i. 801).... The identification firmly fixed of Sophytes
and Saubhûta dissipates henceforward all doubts. Among the
names classed in the Gana-pâtha under the rubric Sâmkala, etc.,
is found <i>Subhûta</i>, which gives, in virtue of the rule stated, <i>Saubhûta</i>
as the name of a locality. Everything concurs in proving
the correctness of our identification.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spitakes</span> is supposed to be the same as the Pittakos mentioned

<p><span class="smcap">Stasanôr</span>, a distinguished officer in Alexander’s army, was
a native of Soloi in Cyprus. For services rendered during the
Baktrian campaign he was appointed satrap of Areia and afterwards
of Drangiana. In the first partition of the provinces after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
Alexander’s death he was confirmed in his satrapy; but in the
partition made at Triparadeisos he received the more important
government of Baktria and Sogdiana. He ruled his subjects
with justice and moderation. He is not heard of in history after
316 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stateira</span> or <span class="smcap">Barsinê</span>, the daughter of Darius and wife of
Alexander, was murdered after his death by Roxana with the
consent of the regent Perdikkas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stephanos</span> of Byzantium was the author of a geographical
lexicon, in which the names of some Indian towns occur. His
date is uncertain, but may be referred to the sixth or seventh
century of our aera.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strabo</span>, the great geographer, was a native of Amasea in
Pontos. He lived in the reign of Augustus, and during the first
five years at least of Tiberius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sibyrtios</span> was appointed by Alexander on returning from
India satrap of Karmania, and afterwards of Arachosia and
Gedrosia in succession to Thoas. He was confirmed in his
government in accordance with the first and the second partition
of the provinces. He incurred the displeasure of Eumenes, and
thereby secured the patronage of Antigonos. Megasthenes was
his friend, and at one time resided with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taurôn</span> was an officer in Alexander’s army, who distinguished
himself in the battle with Pôros.</p>

<p id="Taxiles"><span class="smcap">Taxilês</span>, whose personal name was Omphis, ruled a fertile
territory between the Indus and Hydaspês, which had for its
capital the great and flourishing city of Taxila. He was at feud
with his neighbour, King Pôros, and this probably determined
him to send an embassy to Alexander while he was yet in Baktria,
in the hopes of forming an alliance with him which would
enable him to crush his powerful rival. He waited on Alexander
before he had crossed the Indus, and when he reached Taxila
entertained him and his army with the most liberal hospitality.
After the defeat and submission of Pôros, Alexander effected a
reconciliation between the two princes. Taxilês gave all the
assistance in his power to help forward the construction and
equipment of the fleet by which Alexander intended to convey
a portion of his troops down the Hydaspês and the Indus to the
ocean. For this service he was rewarded with an accession of
territory. After the death of Alexander he was allowed to retain
his power, which had been increased after the murder of the
satrap Philip. Subsequently to the year 321 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Eudêmos
seems to have exercised supreme authority in his province. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
know nothing regarding Taxilês after that date. M. Sylvain
Lévi shows that the personal name of Taxilês is incorrectly
given by Diodôros as <i>Mophis</i> instead of <i>Omphis</i>, which is the
form in Curtius. He gives the reason thus: “The study of the
words transcribed from the Indian languages into Greek proves
that the ο corresponds to an <i>â</i> or to an <i>o</i> in Sanskrit, while the
φ is the regular transcription of <i>bh</i>. Mophis gives therefore a
Sanskrit <i>Mobhi</i> or <i>Mâbhi</i>; neither the one nor the other is met
with in the texts; they are both strangers to the language as well
as to the history of India. But <i>Âmbhi</i> presents itself in the Gana-pâtha,
a genuine appendix to the <i>Grammar</i> of Pânini.” He then
shows that <i>Âmbhi</i> has been obtained from <i>Ambhas</i> in accordance
with an established rule, and thus proceeds: “A double conclusion
unfolds itself—1st, The dynasty which was reigning at
Takśaśilâ at the time of the Greek invasion was a family of
Kshatriya descended from Ambhas, and designated by the
patronymic Âmbhi; 2nd, The dynasty Âmbhi has disappeared
with the Greek rule soon after the death of Alexander. The
revolt of India has swept away without doubt these allies of the
stranger. Before the end of the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Chandragupta,
founder of the Mauryan dynasty and king of the Prasyas, joined
to his dominions the kingdoms of the basin of the Indus. Takśaśilâ
became the residence of a Mauryan governor. The
part played by the Âmbhi does not appear to have been considerable
enough to preserve their memory long; the mention of
them in the <i>Gana-pâtha</i> is the only known testimony to their
existence. The <i>Gana-pâtha</i>, and, at the same time, the <i>Grammar</i>
of Pânini, which is inseparable from it, are then <i>very probably
contemporary with the Macedonian invasion</i>.” He adds as a
footnote, “The mention of the Yavanas (Greeks) and of the
Yavanâni (Greek writing) excludes the hypothesis of priority”
(See <i>Journal Asiatique</i> for 1890, pp. 234-236).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> In saying this, I do not forget that the Graeco-Baktrian
kings at one time extended their sway in India even far beyond the parts
conquered by Alexander; but this cannot be regarded as having resulted
from his invasion. It might have equally happened had his invasion
been as mythical as the Indian expeditions of Dionysos and Heraklês.
Nor do I by any means overlook the effects produced by Greek ideas on
the Indian mind—effects which can be traced in a variety of spheres,
such as religion, poetry, philosophy, science, architecture, and the
plastic arts. On this subject Professor A. Weber read a very learned
paper, entitled “Die Griechen in Indien,” before the Prussian Academy of
Sciences in July 1890. It is a paper which well deserves to be translated
into our language. Scholars now rather incline to believe that, whatever
may be the exact degree of the indebtedness of India to Greece, the
ancient civilization of India was much less original and self-contained
than it was at one time supposed to be.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Patroklês, who held an important command in the East under
Seleukos Nikatôr and his son Antiochos I., stated, in a work (now lost)
which included a description of India, that while the army of Alexander
took but a very hasty view of everything (in India), Alexander himself
took a more exact one, causing the whole country to be described by
men well acquainted with it. This description, Patroklês says, was put
into his hands by Xenoklês the Treasurer. On this subject Humboldt thus
writes: “The Macedonian campaign, which opened so large and beautiful a
portion of the earth to the influence of one sole highly-gifted race,
may therefore certainly be regarded in the strictest sense of the word
as a <i>scientific</i> expedition, and, moreover, as the first in which
a conqueror had surrounded himself with men learned in all departments
of science, as naturalists, geometricians, historians, philosophers, and

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> General Chesney, commenting lately on these numbers,
remarks that “numbers without discipline are, after a certain point,
worse than useless, the men only get in each others’ way. This was
especially the case in the battles of old times fought at close
quarters.” “The biographers of Sir Charles Napier,” he continues, “have
made a great point of the circumstance that at the battle of Meani the
British force of less than 3000 men was opposed by 40,000 of the enemy
who fought desperately for several hours. Now, the whole British loss
in killed and wounded was under 300, so that, assuming every wound to
have been inflicted by a separate sword or bullet, it follows that out
of the 40,000 desperate fighters, 39,700 contributed nothing to the
fighting.” In another passage he points out that an ancient battle was
in some respects a much more formidable thing than a modern one. In the
battle of old days the absence of noise, except the words of command,
the tramp of men, and the clashing of armour, above all the closeness of
one’s adversary, must have been of a kind to try the nerves much more
than the rattle of musketry, the crashing of shells, and the thunder of
the artillery in a modern battle. What we shall never get back to is
hand-to-hand fighting at close quarters. It was this that made a battle
so decisive in olden days, and caused the tremendous slaughter that used
to be the fate of the beaten side. An ancient battle was really a very
short affair. After the marshalling of the troops and the preliminary
skirmishing of the cavalry and the archery practice of the light troops,
in which a good deal of time would be taken up, the business must have
been decided in a very few minutes when once the infantry actually
engaged. The fact is that when two bodies of men meet with sword or
spear, a prolonged contest is from the nature of the case impossible. In
modern warfare when a battle is lost, a large part of the defeated army
is already at a distance and gets off unharmed. But there was no escape
for the man in armour, and when he turned his back his shield was no
defence.</p>

name occupied a mountainous part of Media (Herod. i. 101), and another is
located by Isidoros of Charax between Drangiana and Arachosia. Another

the Central Hindu Kush, which forms the northern frontier of Kâbul.
Its native designation was Parapamisos, or, as Ptolemy more correctly
transliterates it, Paropanisos. Till Alexander’s time these mountains
were altogether unknown to the Greeks. The officers of his army who
wrote accounts of his Asiatic expedition sometimes considered them to
be a continuation of the Tauros, and sometimes of the Kaukasos. Arrian,
who regarded them as an extension of the former range, says that the
Macedonian soldiers called them Kaukasos to flatter Alexander, as if,
when he had crossed them to enter Baktria, he had carried his victorious
arms beyond Kaukasos. The Greeks of those days, it must be observed,
had no definite knowledge of the mountains to which that name was
properly applicable, but vaguely conceived them to be the loftiest and
the remotest to be found in the eastern parts of the world. The pass by
which Alexander recrossed the Paropanisos was most probably the Kushan or
Ghorbund Pass.</p>

southern and eastern sides. They thus occupied the whole of Kabulistân,

generally designated in the classics by their territorial or dynastic
titles. The father of Omphis died about the time Alexander was making his
preparations to invade India.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> Peukelaôtis designated both a district and its capital
city. The name is a transliteration of Pukkalaoti, which is the Pali form
of the Sanskrit Pushkalavati, the name by which the ancient capital
of Gândhâra was known. General Cunningham has fixed its position at the
two large towns of Parang and Chârsada, which form part of Hashtnagar,
or <i>eight cities</i>, that are seated close together on the eastern
bank of the Landaï or lower Swât river. The position thus indicated is
nearly seventeen miles to the north-west of Peshâwar. The city was in
early times a great emporium of commerce. Ptolemy, who with the author
of the Periplûs of the Erythraian sea, calls it Proklaïs, has correctly
located it on the eastern bank of the river of Souastênê, <i>i.e.</i> the
river of Swât. Wilson, however, and Abbott take Pekhely (or Pakholi) in
the neighbourhood of Peshâwar to be the modern representative of the old
Gândhârian capital (<i>v.</i> Cunningham’s <i>Anc. Geog. of India</i>,

its progress. They were not so heavily armed as the hoplites, and were
therefore more rapid in their movements. The foot companions were another

<p><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">[40]</a> Strabo (xv. 697) states the reasons which led Alexander to
select the northern route to the Indus in preference to the southern.
“Alexander was informed,” he says, “that the mountainous and northern
parts were the most habitable and fertile, but that the southern part
was either without water or liable to be overflowed by rivers at one
time, or entirely burnt up at another, more fit to be the haunts of
wild beasts than the dwellings of men. He resolved therefore to master
first that part of India which had been well spoken of, considering at
the same time that the rivers which it was necessary to pass, and which
flowed transversely through the country which he proposed to attack,
would be crossed with more facility towards their sources.” The districts
through which he passed are now called Kafiristan, Chittral, Swât, and
the Yusufzai country. It is more difficult to trace in this than in any
other of his campaigns the course of his movements, and to identify with
certainty the various strongholds which he attacked. The country through
which he passed is but little known even at the present day, and, as
Bunbury remarks, a glance at the labyrinth of mountains and valleys,
which occupy the whole space in question in the best modern maps, will
sufficiently show how utterly bewildering they must have been to the
officers of Alexander, who neither used maps nor the compass, and were
incapable of the simplest geographical observations. The time occupied by
Alexander in marching from the foot of Kaukasos to the Indus was about a
year. Like Napoleon, he kept the field even in winter, though in these
parts the cold at that season is intense.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41" class="label">[41]</a> Khôês. This is the first river Alexander would reach after
he had left his encampment near the junction of the Panjshîr with the
Kôphên, which appears to have been the place where he divided his army.
It cannot have been, as Lassen thought, the Kamah or Kunâr, but is rather
the stream formed by the junction of the Alishang and the Alinghar, which
joins the Kôphên on the left in the neighbourhood of Mandrour above
Jalâlâbâd. The Alinghar river, as we learn from Masson, is called also
the <i>Kow</i>. The Kôa of Ptolemy must not be confounded with the Khôês
of the text, for that author in describing the Kôa says that it receives
a tributary from the Paropanisadai, and that after being joined by
the Souastos (the river of Swât) it falls into the Indus. The Kôa is
therefore probably the Kôphên after its reception of the Kamah or Kunâr
river.</p>

doubt, the river which Aristotle, Strabo, and Curtius call the Choaspes,
and which the best authorities identify with the Kamah or Kunâr, a river
which rivals the Kôphên itself in the volume of its waters and the length
of its course. It rises at the foot of the plateau of Pamîr, not far from
the sources of the Oxus, and joins the Kôphên at some distance below
Jalâlâbâd. Strabo says that the Choaspes traverses Bandobênê (Badakshan)

Gorydalê.</p>

may perhaps, as V. de Saint-Martin suggests, be those which Justin (xii.
7) calls Daedali, whereto he says Alexander led his troops after the
Bacchanalian revelry with which they had been indulged at Nysa. There is
no mention elsewhere of Arigaion, unless it be the “Argacum urbem” of the

ancient gods of the Egyptians, and, as they say themselves, it was
17,000 years before the reign of Amasis, when the number of their gods
was increased from eight to twelve, of whom Heraklês was accounted one.
And being desirous of obtaining certain information from whatever source
I could, I sailed to Tyre in Phoenicia, where, as I had been informed,
there was a temple dedicated to Heraklês.” The name of the Egyptian
Heraklês was Dsona or Chôn, or, according to Pausanias, Makeris, and
that of the Tyrian was Melkart. These were more ancient than the Theban
Heraklês, the son of Zeus and Alkmênê. The Indian Heraklês, called
Dorsanes, who, according to Arrian, was the father of Pandaia, has been
identified with Śiva, but also with Balarâma, the eighth avatâr of
Vishnu. Diodôros (ii. 39) ascribes to him the building of the walls and
of the palace of Palibothra (now Pâtnâ). Arrian in the second book of
this work (c. 16) distinguishes the Tyrian Heraklês from the Egyptian and
Argive or Theban. The latter, he says, lived about the time of Oidipous,
son of Laios.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="label">[55]</a> Peukelaôtis, as has been stated, stood on the Landaï at a
distance of seventeen miles north-west from Peshâwar. Alexander after the
fall of Bazira moved westwards toward that river, judging it expedient
before attacking the Rock to reduce all the yet unconquered region
west of the Indus. He took Peukelaôtis, and then directed his march
eastward till he approached the embouchure of the Kôphên, whence turning
northwards he advanced up the right bank of the Indus till he reached
Embolima, about eight miles distant from Aornos, and as high up the river

<p><a id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="label">[56]</a> Kôphaios, to judge from his name and from what is here

Kâbul river. Hence it is unlikely, as some have supposed, that the
dominions of Taxilês lay partly in the country west of the Indus. I find
nothing anywhere in the classical writers lending countenance to such a
supposition. The name of Assagetes is probably a transliteration into
Greek of the Sanskrit <i>Aśvajit</i>, “gaining horses by conquest.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="label">[57]</a> Ritter taking Embolima to be a word of Greek origin,
equivalent in meaning to ἐκβολή, “the mouth of a river,” thought that
this place lay opposite to Attak, in the angle of land where the Kôphên
discharges into the Indus, and was thus led to identify Aornos with the
hill in that locality on which the fort of Raja Hodi stands. Embolima
appears, however, to be rather a combination of two native names, Amb
and Balimah. Amb is the name of a fort, now in ruins, from which runs
the ordinary path up to the summit of Mahâban. It crowns a position of
remarkable strength, which faces Derbend, a small town on the opposite
side of the Indus. Not far westward from this fort, and on the same spur
of the Mahâban, there is another fort also in ruins, which preserves to
this day in the tradition of the inhabitants the name of Balimah. It is
in accordance with Indian custom thus to combine into one the names of
two neighbouring places.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_59" href="#FNanchor_59" class="label">[59]</a> “All this account,” says Abbott, who takes Aornos to
be Mount Mahâban, “will answer well for the Mahâban, which is a
mountain-table about five miles in length at summit, scarped on the east
by tremendous precipices from which descends one large spur down upon
the Indus between Sitana and Amb. The mountain spur being comparatively
easy of ascent would not probably be contested by the natives, who would
concentrate their power to oppose the Macedonians as they climbed the
precipitous fall of the main summit. The great extent of the mountain,
covered as it is with pine forest, would enable Ptolemy, under the
guidance of natives, to gain any distant point of the summit without
observation.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_62" href="#FNanchor_62" class="label">[62]</a> On descending the Mahâban by its northern or western spurs,
Alexander would have found himself in the valleys of Chumla and Buner.
The fugitives from the rock would no doubt flee for shelter to these
valleys or the mountains by which they were enclosed. Dyrta probably lay
to the north of Mahâban, near the point where the Indus issues from the
mountains. Court’s opinion that Dyrta was a place so far remote from
the rock as Dir, which lies beyond the Pañjkora river, seems altogether
improbable. Yet it is adopted by Lassen, though the regions in which Dir
is situated had already been subdued.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63" class="label">[63]</a> “This road,” says Abbott, “was probably the path leading
amongst precipices above and along the torrent of the Burindu, a river
which, after watering the valleys of Buner and Chumla, flows into the
Indus above Amb. The path even now is very difficult. This would have
brought Alexander back to Amb.” On this route probably lay the pass which
the chief called Eryx by Curtius and Aphrikes by Diodôros attempted, but
unsuccessfully, to defend against Alexander. The river Burindu above
mentioned may be identified with the <i>Parenos</i> of the Greek writers.</p>

than it does at present. At one time forests of fine sisoo, mulberry,
and willow timber grew along both banks of the Indus at that part of its
course.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="label">[67]</a> The bridge in all probability spanned the Indus near
Attak, which stands on a steep and lofty part of the left bank about
two miles below the junction of the Kâbul and Indus. The width of the
latter river at the fortress of Attak is, according to Lieutenant Wood
who measured it, 286 yards. A little lower down where the channel is
usually spanned by a bridge of boats it varies, as stated by Vigne, from
80 to 120 yards. According to Cunningham, the bridge was made higher
up the river, at Ohind. From Alexander’s campaign north of the Kâbul
river, General Chesney (in a lecture at Simla) hints that a <i>moral</i>
may be drawn:—“We have been accustomed,” he says, “to consider the
country north of the Kâbul river as virtually impregnable. The march of
Alexander’s army is a practical proof to the contrary, and although he
was not burdened with artillery, and had apparently only mule transport,
yet the Greek soldiers all marched in heavy armour, which must have added
greatly to the difficulties of warfare among those mountains. There is an
obvious moral to be drawn by us from these incidents.”</p>

5: “When the Greeks noticed a cave in the dominions of the Paropamisadai,
they asserted that it was the cave of Promêtheus the Titan, in which he
had been suspended for stealing the fire.” At the distance of thirty-four
miles from Birikot, a place near the river Swât, is Daityapûr, now called
Daiti-Kalli, said to have been built by one of the Daityas, <i>i.e.</i>
<i>enemies of the gods</i>, such as were the Titans of the Greeks. In
the hill adjacent is a vast cavern which, as Abbott has suggested, the
companions of Alexander may have taken to be the cave frequented by the
eagle which preyed upon the vitals of Prometheus the Titan. At Bamiân,
which lies on one of the routes from Kâbul to Baktria, there are some
very notable caves, one of which, some think, must have been that which
the Greeks took to be the cave of Promêtheus. But Alexander does not
appear to have selected the Bamiân route either in crossing or recrossing
the Kaukasos. The mountains of the real Kaukasos were the loftiest known
to the Greeks before Alexander’s time, and hence to have crossed them was
regarded as a transcendent achievement.</p>

on a lofty Himalayan peak, Mount Kailâsa, famous in Hindu fable as the
residence of Śiva and the Paradise of Kuvera, and that before it issues
into the plains it has nearly run the half of its course of about 1800
miles. The number of its mouths has varied from time to time. Ptolemy,

close of day seems to descend. It was, therefore, Ritter says, the name
applied by the Brahmans to all the provinces in India that lay towards
sunset. Cunningham, however, suggests that Pâtali, a Sanskrit word
meaning <i>the trumpet-flower</i> (<i>bignonia suaveolens</i>) may have
given its name to the Delta “in allusion,” he says, “to the ‘trumpet’
shape of the province included between the eastern and western branches
of the mouth of the Indus, as the two branches as they approach the sea
curve outwards like the mouth of a trumpet.” But could the idea of such
a resemblance have occurred to the minds of the Indians unless maps
were in use among them? For a better etymology see <a href="#NoteU">Note U</a>. It has been

<p><a id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85" class="label">[85]</a> Regarding the Maiôtic Lake, now generally called the Sea
of Azof, the ancients entertained very hazy and inaccurate notions. They
supposed it to be situated in the remotest regions of the earth (Aisch.
<i>Prom.</i> 427), and to be almost equal in size to the Euxine (Herod,
iv. 86). Arrian, who might have known better, seems here to have adopted
the crude notion current in Alexander’s time that the Jaxartes (which
they confounded with the Tanais or Don) entered by one arm the Hyrkanian
or Kaspian Sea, and by another the Maiôtic Lake. The Kaspian itself was
taken to be a gulf of the Great Eastern Ocean. Herodotos, however, is
guiltless of this geographical heresy.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_95" href="#FNanchor_95" class="label">[95]</a> We learn from Curtius that Alexander, before taking
hostile action against Pôros, demanded from him through an envoy called
Cleochares that he should pay tribute and come to meet him on the
frontiers of his dominions. To this Pôros replied that in compliance
with the second request he would meet Alexander at the place appointed,
but would attend in arms. Alexander was perhaps justified by the laws
of war in exacting submission from the tribes west of the Indus, since
these had been subject to Darius, whom he had overthrown, and to whose
rights he had succeeded, but the tribes of the Panjâb, those at least
that lay to the east of the Hydaspês, had never, so far as is known,
been under Persian domination, and hence his invasion, according to
modern ideas, was altogether indefensible. He could, however, justify
himself on the ground of the principles held by the Greeks of his day,
who considered that their superiority in wisdom and virtue to the rest
of mankind gave them a natural right to attack, plunder, and enslave
all barbarians except such only as were protected by a special treaty.
Such a view, repugnant as it seems to every principle of justice, was
held nevertheless by Aristotle, who no doubt impressed it on the mind
of his illustrious pupil. Hence Alexander, in attacking Pôros, was not
conscious, like Caesar, when he invaded Britain, of perpetrating an
unwarrantable aggression for which some kind of an excuse had to be
trumped up.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_96" href="#FNanchor_96" class="label">[96]</a> The Hydaspês, now the Jhîlam, is called by the natives of
Kâśmîr, where it rises, the Bedasta, which is but a slightly altered
form of its Sanskrit name, the Vitastâ, which means “wide-spread.”
In Ptolemy’s geography it appears as the Bidaspês—a form nearer the
original than <i>Hydaspês</i>. It is mentioned in one of the hymns of
the Rig-Veda, along with other great Indian rivers: “Receive favourably
this my hymn, O Gangâ, Yamunâ, Sarasvatî, Śutudrî, Parashni; hear O
Marudvridhâ, with the Asiknî and <i>Vitastâ</i>, and thou Arjîkîyâ with
the Sushômâ.” In advancing from the Indus at Attak to the Hydaspês,
Alexander followed the Râjapatha, that is, the <i>king’s highway</i>,
called by Megasthenes the ὁδὸς βασιληίη. It is the route which has been
taken by all foreign conquerors who have penetrated into India by the
valley of the Kôphês. Elphinstone, who followed this route in returning
from Kâbul, describes it thus: “The whole of our journey across the track
between the Indus and Hydaspês was about 160 miles; for which space
the country is among the strongest I have ever seen. The difficulty of
our passage across it was increased by heavy rain. While in the hilly
country our road sometimes lay through the beds of torrents” (<i>Mission
to Kâbul</i>, p. 78). In another passage (p. 80) he says: “I was greatly
struck with the difference between the banks of this river; the left bank
had all the characteristics of the plains of India. The right bank, on
the contrary, was formed by the end of the range of the Salt Hills, and
had an air of extreme ruggedness and wildness that must inspire a fearful
presentiment of the country he was entering into the mind of a traveller
from the East.” General Chesney, in the lecture already cited, thus
remarks on the advance of Alexander to the Hydaspês: “What is remarkable
about this part of the advance is that it was not made direct on Jhelum,
as would appear natural. True, that line is over what would be a very
difficult country, as any traveller by the existing road knows. Still it
would be the easiest line; nevertheless it appears certain that Alexander
took a more southerly line, and threading his way through the intricate
ravines of the upper part of the Salt range, and leaving Tilla and Rhotas
on his left, penetrated that range by the gorge through which runs the
Bhundar river, and struck the river Jhelum at Jalâlpûr, about thirty
miles below Jhelum.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="label">[101]</a> Curtius mentions that near the bluff there was a deep
hollow or ravine which sufficed to screen both the infantry and the
cavalry, and on this Cunningham remarks: “There is a ravine to the north
of Jalâlpûr which exactly suits the descriptions of the historians. This
ravine is the bed of the Kandar Nala, which has a course of six miles
from its source down to Jalâlpûr, where it is lost in a waste of sand. Up
this ravine there has always been a passable, but difficult road towards
Jhelum. From the head of the Kandar this road proceeds for three miles
in a northerly direction down another ravine called the Kasi, which then
turns suddenly to the east for six and a half miles, and then again one
and a half mile to the south, where it joins the river Jhelum immediately
below Dilâwar, the whole distance from Jalâlpûr being exactly seventeen
miles.” These seventeen miles are about the equivalent of the 150 stadia
given by Arrian as the distance from the great camp to the bluff.</p>

could see each other and communicate his orders. Now, I believe that this
operation could not be carried out in the face of an observant enemy
along any part of the river bank, excepting only that one part which lies
between Jalâlpûr and Dilâwar. In all other parts the west bank is open
and exposed, but in this part alone the wooded and rocky hills slope down
to the river and offer sufficient cover for the concealment of single
sentries.”—<i>Geog. of Anc. India</i>, pp. 170, 171.</p>

Hannibal’s passage of the Rhone made upwards of a century later. The

<p><a id="Footnote_106" href="#FNanchor_106" class="label">[106]</a> This passage, as interpreted by Droysen, Thirlwall, and
indeed as generally understood, intimates that Alexander ordered Koinos
to station himself opposite <i>the enemy’s</i> right, and not on the
<i>Macedonian</i> extreme right. Thus Moberly, who holds the general
view, remarks (<i>Alexander in the Punjaub</i>, p. 61):—“Coenus was
ordered to station himself opposite the enemy’s right; then, in case
of Porus withdrawing all his cavalry from the right, in order to meet
Alexander’s attack on the left, Coenus was to pass from one wing to the
other, apparently in front of the Macedonian line, and to attack the
Indian cavalry in the rear as soon as, in advancing to meet Alexander,
they had got some little distance from their supports.... Distance can
be got over quickly by cavalry.” Köchly and Rüstow, however, in their
<i>History of the Greek Military System</i>, advocate a different view.
“Alexander,” they say, “must have sent Koinos to the extreme right wing
with the order, that if the cavalry broke from the line against himself
(Alexander) he was to fall upon their rear. Had he been detached to
oppose the right wing of Pôros he would have been too far off to support
Alexander’s front attack by an attack on the enemy’s rear.” This seems
the preferable view.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_107" href="#FNanchor_107" class="label">[107]</a> “To meet the double assault (of Alexander and Coenus) they
resorted to one of those changes of front in which Indian cavalry are
often so surprisingly rapid—facing partly to the front and partly to
the rear. Yet Alexander was beforehand with them; and his renewed charge
threw them into utter confusion before they could fully assume their new
formation. Flying along the front of their own infantry, they took refuge
in the spaces left between every two elephants, and (as it would seem in
the absence, from Arrian’s account, of the full details) passed as soon
as possible through the intervals of the foot regiments, so as to be for
the moment quite outside the battle. As soon as they were out of the way
the Indian elephants were sent on, supported by the infantry, but were at
once met face to face by the Macedonian phalanx.”—<i>v.</i> Moberly’s

respect to its sister city Boukephala, the ancient writers are not
in agreement. Plutarch places it on the left or eastern bank of the
Hydaspês, for he says that Boukephalas was killed in the battle, and that
the city was built where he fell and was buried. According, however,
to Strabo, Arrian, and Diodôros, it stood on the west bank; but while
Strabo places it at the point where the troops embarked, Arrian places
it farther down the stream on the site of the great camp at Jalâlpûr.
It became a great emporium of commerce, as we find from the <i>Periplûs

becomes Sandrophagos. This word suggested to the soldiers of Alexander
another of bad omen, <i>Ale-xandrophagos</i>, which means <i>devourer of
Alexander</i>, and hence they adopted its other name, perhaps on account
of the disaster which befell the Macedonian fleet at the turbulent
junction of this river with the Hydaspês. In Ptolemy’s <i>Geography</i>

receiving the Hyphasis among the Astrybai, and the Saranges from the

by the classical writers the Bibasis, the Hypasis, and the Hypanis. Its
Sanskrit name is the <i>Vipâsâ</i>, which means “uncorded,” and it is
said to have been so called because it <i>destroyed the cord</i> with
which one of the Indian sages intended to hang himself. It joins the
Satlej (not the Hydraôtês, as Arrian says in his <i>Indika</i>) and the
united stream is called in Sanskrit the Śatadru, <i>i.e.</i> “flowing in
a hundred channels.” It marked the limit of Alexander’s advance eastward.
In his time it flowed in a different channel, one by which it reached the
Chenâb about 40 miles above Uchh. Curtius and Diodôros inform us that
Alexander before reaching this river had entered the dominions of King
Sôphites, who submitted without resistance, and was therefore left in
possession of his sovereignty. Another chief (called Phêgeus by Diodôros,
but more correctly Phegelas by Curtius), whose dominions adjoined the
Hyphasis, entertained Alexander and his army for two days. By this time
he had been rejoined by Hêphaistiôn, who had been conducting operations
elsewhere, and he then proceeded to the bank of the river. The country
beyond it Arrian represents as exceedingly fertile, whereas in Curtius

it which would occupy a journey of eleven days. Arrian’s statement holds
true of the northern districts beyond the river, and the other statement
of the southern districts. Thirlwall, following the latter statement,
takes it that Alexander reached the Satlej after it had received the
Hyphasis, but this is a very questionable view.</p>

and Persepolis he conceived an ardent desire to sail down the Euphrates
and Tigres to the Persian sea, and survey their mouths.... Some writers
have stated that he had in contemplation a voyage round the greater
portion of Arabia, the land of the Aethiopians, Lybia, and Numidia beyond
Mount Atlas to Gadeira (Cadiz) inward into the Mediterranean.” One of
the writers referred to is Plutarch, who says (<i>Alexander</i>, c. 68):
“Nearchos joined him (Alexander) here (at the capital of Gedrosia),
and he was so much delighted with the account of his voyage that he
formed a design to sail in person from the Euphrates with a great fleet,
circle the coast of Arabia and Africa, and enter the Mediterranean
by the Pillars of Hercules.” Herodotos (iv. 42) says that Nekô, king
of the Egyptians, sent certain Phoenicians in ships with orders to
sail back through the Pillars of Hercules into the Northern Sea (the
Mediterranean that is), and so to return to Egypt. The pillars
designated the twin rocks which guard the entrance to the Mediterranean
at the eastern extremity of the Straits of Gibraltar, the one on the
European side being called <i>Kalpê</i>, and that on the African side,
where now stands the citadel of Ceuta, <i>Abila</i> or <i>Abyla</i>.

variety of other trees fit for shipbuilding, and brought the timber down
the Hydaspês. With this he constructed a fleet on the Hydaspês near the
cities which he built on each side of the river where he had crossed it
and conquered Pôros. “The timber,” says Sir A. Burnes, “of which the
boats of the Panjâb are constructed is chiefly floated down <i>by the

the selection of its banks by Alexander in preference to the other
rivers.” Bunbury, citing this passage, adds: “The navigation of the Indus

as to justify their observations. The resemblance of the lower valley
of the Indus from the time it has received the waters of the Panjab

Mr. Elphinstone) might serve for both. A smooth and fertile plain is
bounded on one side by mountains, and on the other by a desert. It is
divided by a large river, which forms a Delta as it approaches the sea,

<p><a id="Footnote_147" href="#FNanchor_147" class="label">[147]</a> Diodôros and Curtius, as has been pointed out (in <a href="#NoteM">Note
M</a>), place the dominions of Sôpeithês between the upper Hydraôtês and the
Hyphasis, but here we find them transferred to a more western position.
Strabo was unable to decide where they lay. “Some writers (he says) place
Kathaia and the country of Sôpeithês, one of the monarchs, in the tract
between the rivers (Hydaspês and Akesinês); some on the other side of the
Akesinês and of the Hyarotis, on the confines of the territory of the
other Pôros, the nephew of Pôros who was taken prisoner by Alexander,
and call the country subject to him Gandaris.... It is said that in
the territory of Sôpeithês there is a mountain composed of fossil salt
sufficient for the whole of India. Valuable mines, also, both of gold
and silver, are situated, it is said, not far off among other mountains,
according to the testimony of Gorgos the miner.” Strabo then describes
(as do also Diodôros and Curtius) the fight between a lion and four dogs
which Sôpeithês exhibited to Alexander. To account for the discrepancy
in these statements one is almost tempted to believe that as there were
two princes of the name of Pôros, each ruling dominions of his own, so
there were also two chiefs of the name of Sôpeithês or (as Curtius more
correctly transcribes it) Sôphytês. General Cunningham would identify
<i>Gandaris</i> with the present district of <i>Gundulbâr</i> or
<i>Gundurbâr</i>, and fixes the capital of Sôphytês on the western bank
of the Hydaspês at <i>Old Bhira</i>, a place near Ahmedabad, with a very
extensive mound of ruins, and distant from Nikaia (now Mong) three days
by water. His rule must have extended westward to the Indus, since the
mountain of rock-salt which Strabo includes in his territory can only
refer to the salt range (the Mount Oromenus of Pliny, xxxi. 39) which
extends from the Indus to the Hydaspês. The transcription of the name
<i>Sôphytês</i> will be found discussed elsewhere.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_148" href="#FNanchor_148" class="label">[148]</a> Arrian in his <i>Indika</i>, where he apparently follows
Nearchos instead of Ptolemy as here, gives the whole number of ships
at only 800, including both ships of war and transports. Schmieder
and some other editors would correct this to 1800, but it seems more
probable, Bunbury thinks, that the basis of the two calculations was
different. Ptolemy, he says, distinctly includes the ordinary river boats
which would doubtless have been collected in large numbers to assist
in transporting so great an army and its supplies; while the terms of
Nearchos would seem to imply only ships of war or regular transports.
Krüger would correct the 2000 of the text to 1000, which is the number
of the vessels as given by Diodôros and Curtius. The fleet began the

at the confluence of the two rivers with the Indus. The dangers of their
navigation seem to have been exaggerated by the ancient writers, though
their accounts have some foundation in fact. Sir A. Burnes, the first
European known to have visited the spot, says there are no eddies and no
rocks, nor is the channel confined, while the ancient character is only
supported by the noise of the confluence, which is greater than that of
any of the other rivers. The boatmen of the locality, however, still
regard the passage as a perilous one during the season when the river is
swollen (v. <i>Travels</i>, i. p. 109). Thirlwall thinks the principal
obstructions have been worn away. According to Curtius, Alexander’s own
ship was here in imminent danger of being wrecked.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_158" href="#FNanchor_158" class="label">[158]</a> General Cunningham has identified this place with
Kot-Kamâlia, a small but ancient town situated on an isolated mound
on the right or northern bank of the Râvi, marking the extreme limit
of the river’s fluctuations on that side. The small rivulet on which
Alexander encamped at the end of his first march he believes to be the
lower course of the Ayek river which rises in the outer range of hills
and flows past Syâlkot towards Sâkala, below which the bed is still
traceable for some distance. It appears again, he says, eighteen miles
to the east of Jhang, and is finally lost about two miles to the east
of Shorkot. Now somewhere between these two points Alexander must have
crossed the Ayek, as the desert country which he afterwards traversed
lies immediately beyond it. If he had marched to the south he would have
arrived at Shorkot, but he would not have encountered any desert, as his
route would have been over the Khâdar, or low-lying lands in the valley
of the Chenâb. A march of forty-six miles in a southerly direction would
have carried him also right up to the bank of the Hydraôtês or Râvi,
a point which Alexander only reached after another night’s march. As
this march lasted from the first watch until daylight, it cannot have
been less than eighteen or twenty miles, which agrees exactly with the
distance of the Râvi opposite Tulamba from Kot-Kamâlia. The direction of
Alexander’s march must therefore have been to the south-east; first to
the Ayek river, and thence across the hard, clayey, and waterless tract
called Sandar-bâr, that is the bâr, a desert of the Sandar or Chandra
river. Thus the position of the rivulet, the description of the desolate
country, and the distance of the city from the confluence of the rivers,
all agree in fixing the site of the fortress assaulted by Alexander with
Kot-Kamâlia.—<i>Anc. Geog. of India</i>, pp. 208-210.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_159" href="#FNanchor_159" class="label">[159]</a> The city to which Perdikkas was sent in advance of
Alexander, Cunningham has identified with Harapa. “The mention of
marshes (he says) shows that it must have been near the Râvi, and, as
Perdikkas was sent in advance of Alexander, it must also have been
<i>beyond</i> Kot-Kamâlia, that is to the east or south-east of it. Now
this is exactly the position of Harapa, which is situated sixteen miles
to the east-south-east of Kot-Kamâlia, and on the opposite high bank
of the Râvi. There are also several marshes in the low ground in its
immediate vicinity.” Cunningham then gives a description of Harapa as it
now exists. He had encamped at the place on three different occasions.
It had been visited previously and described both by Burnes and Masson.
Its ruined mound forms an irregular square of half a mile on each side,
or two miles in circuit (<i>Anc. Geog. of India</i>, pp. 210, 211). It
seems to me a serious objection to this identification that Kot-Kamâlia
and Harapa (Harup, in Ainsworth’s large map) lie on <i>opposite</i> sides
of the Râvi, while Arrian’s narrative leads us to suppose that they both
lay to the west of that river. No mention is made of Perdikkas crossing
it, and had the fortress he attacked lain beyond it, he could easily have
intercepted the inhabitants in their flight to the marshes of the river.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_160" href="#FNanchor_160" class="label">[160]</a> Cunningham identifies this well-fortified position with
Tulamba. “A whole night’s march (he says) of eight or nine hours could
not have been less than twenty-five miles, which is the exact distance
of the Râvi opposite Tulamba from Kot-Kamâlia.” It was defended by brick
walls and enormous mounds of earthen ramparts. Tulamba lies on the high
road to Multân, to which, as the capital of the Malloi, Alexander was
marching.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_161" href="#FNanchor_161" class="label">[161]</a> The Brachmans, as is well known, formed a religious
caste, and were not a distinct race or tribe. Their city Cunningham has
identified with the old ruined town and fort of Atâri, which is situated
twenty miles to the west-south-west of Tulamba and on the high road to
Multân, from which it is thirty-four miles distant. The remains consist
of a strong citadel 750 feet square and 35 feet high. On two of its sides
are to be found the remains of the old town. Of its history there is not
even a tradition, but the large size of its bricks shows that it must
be a place of considerable antiquity. The name of the old city is quite
unknown, Atâri being merely that of the adjacent village, which is of
recent origin. Curtius states that Alexander went completely round the
citadel in a boat, and Cunningham thinks this is probable enough, as
its ditch could be filled at pleasure with water from the Râvi. Curtius
must, however, be romancing when he says that the three greatest rivers
in India except the Ganges (Indus, Hydaspês, and Akesinês) joined their
waters to form a ditch round the castle (v. <i>Anc. Geog. of India</i>,
pp. 228-230). The mention of a special city of the Brachmans, Lassen
observes, shows that but few priests lived in this part of the country,
and that they had established themselves in particular cities to protect
themselves against those people by whom they were held in but small
esteem.</p>

of Theophilos; the gorget was of the same metal, and set with precious
stones; the sword, his favourite weapon in battle, was a present from a
Cyprian king, and not to be excelled for lightness or temper; but his
belt, deeply embossed with massive figures, was the most superb part of
his armour; it was a gift from the Rhodians, on which old Helikôn had
exerted all his skill. If we add to these the shield, lance, and light
greaves, we may form a fair idea of his appearance in battle.”</p>

we have the Vasâti or Basâti of the <i>Mahâbhârata</i>, a people whom
Hematchandra in his <i>Geographical Dictionary</i> places between the
Hydaspês and the Indus, on the plateau of which the Salt Mountains form
the southern escarpment. If the Vasâti were really so placed, it can
scarcely be supposed that they would have sent offers of submission to
Alexander, who had already passed through their part of the country,
and was now marching homeward, leaving them far in his rear. Cunningham
prefers to identify them with the <i>Yaudheya</i> or <i>Ajudhiya</i>,
now the <i>Johiyas</i>, who are settled as formerly along the banks
of the lower Satlej. <i>Assodioi</i> or Ossadioi seems a pretty close
transcription of <i>Ajudhiya</i>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_174" href="#FNanchor_174" class="label">[174]</a> The name of this city is not given by any of the
historians, but in all probability it bore the name of its founder. Its
site has generally been referred to the neighbourhood of Mithânkôt,
a town situated on the western bank of the Indus a little below the
junction of that river with the united streams of the Panjâb. V. de
Saint-Martin identifies it more precisely with Chuchpûr or Chuchur, an
ancient fort standing on the eastern bank of the Indus right opposite
Mithânkôt. This fort bore formerly the names of Askalanda, Askelend,
and Sikander, which are but variant forms of Alexandreia. The great
confluence, however, did not anciently take place at Mithânkôt, but at
Uchh, an old city lying forty miles to the north-east of the confluence
at Mithânkôt. The place is called by Rashed-ud-din <i>Askaland-usah</i>,
which, as Cunningham points out, would be an easy corruption of
<i>Alexandria Uchha</i> or <i>Ussa</i>, as the Greeks must have written
it. The word <i>uchha</i> means “high” both in Sanskrit and in Hindi,
and Uchh seems to owe its name to the fact that it stands on a mound.
“Uchh is chiefly distinguished (says Masson) by the ruins of the former
towns, which are very extensive, and attest the pristine prosperity of
the locality.” <i>v.</i> V. de Saint-Martin, <i>Etude</i>, pp. 124, 125;

<p><a id="Footnote_176" href="#FNanchor_176" class="label">[176]</a> In Strabo (XV. i.) we find several references to the
country of Mousikanos. These were based on information supplied by
Onesikritos, who expatiates in praise of its fertility, on the virtues
of its people, and the goodness of the laws and government under which
they lived. It seems now generally agreed that Alôr, which was anciently
and for many ages the metropolis of the rich and powerful kingdom of
Upper Sindh, was the capital of Mousikanos. Its ruins were visited by
M’Murdo and Lieutenant Wood, and afterwards by General Cunningham, who
thus describes their site: “The ruins of Alôr are situated to the south
of a gap in the low range of sandstone hills which stretches from Bhakar
towards the south for about twenty miles until it is lost in a broad belt
of sandhills which bound the Nâra, or old bed of the Indus, on the west.
Through this gap a branch of the Indus once flowed, which protected the
city on the north-west. To the north-east it was covered by a second
branch of the river, which flowed nearly at right angles to the other
at a distance of three miles.... In <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 680 the latter was
probably the main stream of the Indus, which had gradually been working
to the westward from its original bed in the old Nâra.” With regard to
the name of the king it appears to be a territorial title, since Curtius
designates the people <i>Musicani</i>. Lassen (<i>Ind. Alt.</i> ii. 176)
takes this to represent the Sanskrit Mûshika (which means <i>a mouse</i>
or <i>a thief</i>), and points out that a part of the Malabar coast was
also called the Mûshika kingdom. Saint-Martin thinks that the Mûshika
still exist in the great tribe of the Moghsis, which forms the most
numerous part of the population of Kach Gandâra, a region bordering on
the territories of the ancient Mûsikani (<i>Etude</i>, p. 162).</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_177" href="#FNanchor_177" class="label">[177]</a> Curtius calls the subjects of Oxykanos the
Praesti, a name which would indicate that they inhabited a
level country, since the Sanskrit word of which their name is a
transcript—<i>prastha</i>—denotes <i>a tableland</i> or <i>a
level expanse</i>. The name, Saint-Martin thinks, is in Justin
altered to <i>Praesidae</i>; but Justin, it appears to me, means the
Praisioi thereby. Oxykanos is called both by Strabo and Diodôros
<i>Portikanos</i>, representing perhaps the Sanskrit <i>Pârtha</i>,
“a prince.” It is not easy to determine where his dominions lay. They
were not on the Indus, for Alexander left that river to attack them.
Cunningham places them to the west of the Indus in the level country
around Larkhâna, which, though now close to the Indus, was in Alexander’s
time about forty miles distant from it. Their capital he identifies with
Mahorta, a place about ten miles north-west from Larkhâna, where there
are the remains of an ancient fortress on a huge mound, whence perhaps
its name <i>Mâhaurddha</i>, “very high.” Lassen, on the other hand,
followed by Saint-Martin, places the country of Oxykanos to the east of
the river, and therefore in the vast Mesopotamia (the Prasiane of Pliny)
comprised between the old or eastern arm of the Indus and the present
channel (<i>v.</i> Lassen, <i>Ind. Alt.</i> ii. 177; Saint-Martin,
<i>Etude</i>, p. 165; Cunningham, <i>Anc. Geog. of India</i>, pp.

<p><a id="Footnote_180" href="#FNanchor_180" class="label">[180]</a> In the 15th chapter of this book Arrian states that
Alexander had sent Krateros away by this route after he had left the
Sogdian capital (near Bhakar). From this we may infer that Krateros,
soon after he set out on his homeward march, had been temporarily
recalled by Alexander, who may have found the resistance to his arms more
formidable than he had anticipated. Strabo states in one place (XV. ii.
5) that Krateros set out on his march from the Hydaspês and proceeded
through the country of the Arachotoi and the Drangai into Karmania,
and in another (XV. ii. 11) that he traversed Choarênê and entered
Karmania simultaneously with Alexander. Now the former of these routes
would have been so needlessly circuitous that it cannot be supposed it
was that which Krateros selected. He no doubt marched through Choarênê
(the district of Ariana nearest India), to which there was access from
India through the Bolan Pass. Before rejoining Alexander he must have
encountered formidable difficulties in traversing the great desert of
Karman, which occupies the northern part of Karmania, and extends from
thence to the confines of Yezd, Khorasân, and Seïstan. “This desert
(says Bunbury) is a vast track of the most unmitigated barrenness, and a
considerable portion of this interposed between the fertile districts of
Murmansheer in Northern Carmania, and the Lake Zarrah in Seïstan must of
necessity have been traversed by Craterus with his army. An Afghan army
which invaded Persia in 1719 suffered the most dreadful hardships in this
waste” (<i>v.</i> his <i>Hist. of Anc. Geog.</i> p. 522, also Droysen’s

the voyage down stream from Nikaia on the Hydaspês to Patala occupied
ten months. “The Greeks (he says) remained at the Hydaspês while the
ships were constructing, and began their voyage not many days before the
setting of the Pleiades (late in the autumn of <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 326), and
were occupied during the whole autumn, winter, and the ensuing spring
and summer in sailing down the river, and arrived at Patalênê about the
rising of the dog-star (towards the end of summer <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 325).
The passage down the river lasted ten months.” According to Plutarch,
Alexander spent seven months in falling down the rivers to the ocean. Sir
A. Burnes ascended the Indus up to Lahore in sixty days, a distance of
about 1000 miles. He estimated that a boat could drop down from Lahore to
the sea in fifteen days, and from Multân in nine days.</p>

more than sixty miles from the sea, whence Cunningham concludes that
Alexander must then have reached as far as Bambhra on the Ghâra, which is
about fifty miles by water from the sea. The breaking up of the monsoon,

Ptolemy the Lonibari mouth. Its bed is now almost dry except at the time
of the inundations, when it assumes the appearance of a great river. At
the lower part of its course it is known as the Guni. On its east side it
receives the branch of the Indus, which in ancient times passed Arôr, and
is now called the <i>Purana darya</i> or <i>Old river</i>.</p>

on the point where the estuary begins, and which for some months of
the year (from July to October) is inundated by the waters of several
rivers. By a singular coincidence the terrible earthquake of 1819 has
formed a large hollow and created a spacious lake traversed by the Korî,
and occupying probably the same site as the lake mentioned by Arrian.
Brahmanic tradition, moreover, preserves the memory of a lake formerly
existing near the Korî, not far from its embouchure. In the <i>Bhagavata
Purâna</i> translated by Bournouf, we read that ‘in the west at the
confluence of the Sindhu and the ocean is the vast tank of Nârâyana
Saras, which is frequented by the Recluses and the Siddhas.’... A local
tradition picked up by M’Murdo refers to the disappearance of this lake

The south-west monsoon prevails from April to October. It sets in on

<p><a id="Footnote_191" href="#FNanchor_191" class="label">[191]</a> The name of this river has various forms, Arabis, Arbis,
Artabis, and Artabius. It is now called the Purâli and is the river
which, rising in the mountain range called by Ptolemy the Baitian, flows
through the present district of Las into the Bay of Sonmiyâni. It gave
its name to the Arabioi, whose territory it divided from that of the
Oritai, who were farther west. Curtius states that Alexander reached the
eastern boundary of the Arabioi (which may be placed about Karâchi) in
nine days from Patala, and their western boundary formed by the Arabius
in five days more. The distance from Haidarâbâd to Karâchi is 114 miles,
and from Karâchi to Sonmiyâni fifty miles. The average of a day’s march
was therefore about twelve miles, the same as now in these parts.</p>

in Marcian the geographer, <i>Arbitoi</i>; and in Dion. Perieg.
<i>Aribes</i>. Their territories extended from the western mouth of
the Indus to the river Purâli. This people and their neighbours, the
Orîtai, Cunningham would include within the geographical limits of India,
although they have always been beyond its political boundaries during
the historical period. They were tributary to Darius Hystaspês, and were
still subject to the Persians when the Chinese pilgrim Hwen Thsiang
visited their country in the seventh century of our aera.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_193" href="#FNanchor_193" class="label">[193]</a> In the country of the Oreitai is a river called the Aghor,

Aghoritai, Aoritai, Oritai, or Horatae, as they are called by Curtius.
They are the Neoritai of Diodôros. The length of their coast Arrian gives
in his <i>Indika</i> at 1600 stadia, while Strabo extends it to 1800.
The actual length is 100 English miles, somewhere about half of Arrian’s
estimate taken from Nearchos. The western boundary of the Oritai was
marked by Cape Mâlân (the <i>Malana</i> of Arrian), which is twenty miles
distant from the river Aghor. According to Strabo the Oritai were the
people by whose poisoned arrows Ptolemy was all but mortally wounded.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_194" href="#FNanchor_194" class="label">[194]</a> This name is probably a transcription of the Indian
<i>Râmbâgh</i>, which designated the place where pilgrims assemble before
starting for the Aghor Valley, in which the principal sacred places are
connected with the history of Râma, the great hero of the Râmâyana.
Cunningham accordingly identifies Râmbâgh with Arrian’s Rambakia,
and remarks that the occurrence of the name of Râmbâgh at so great a
distance to the west of the Indus, and at so early a period as the time
of Alexander, shows not only the wide extension of Hindu influence
in ancient times, but also the great antiquity of the story of Râma
(<i>v.</i> his <i>Anc. Geog. of India</i>, pp. 307-310).</p>

near the mouth of the Indus, to Firûzâbâd in Mekran. Its situation is
uncertain, however, as its name does not occur in any recently published
account of the country. Ora may perhaps have been in the neighbourhood of
Kôkala, mentioned in the <i>Indika</i> as situated on the Oreitian coast,
probably near Cape Katchari, to the east of the Hingul river, where the
fleet was supplied with a fresh stock of provisions. Perhaps it may have
here denoted the country of the Oreitai.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_196" href="#FNanchor_196" class="label">[196]</a> Gadrôsia in Arrian denotes the <i>inland</i> region
which extends from the Oreitai to Karmania. The <i>maritime</i> region
between the same limits he calls the country of the Ichthyophagoi. The
Gedrôsian desert since the days of Alexander has protected Lower Sindh
from any attack by the maritime route. The Persian invader has preferred
to encounter the dangers and difficulties of the mountain passes of
Afghânistân rather than to expose himself to such horrible sufferings
in the burning desert as were experienced by the soldiers of Semiramis,
Cyrus, and Alexander. The length of the Makrân or Beluchistan coast
between the Oreitai and Karmania is given by Arrian at 10,000 stadia and
by Strabo at 7000 only. The actual length is 480 English miles, and the
time taken by Nearchos in its navigation was twenty days.</p>

preposterous” (<i>Alexander in India</i>, by Heitland and Raven, p. 90).
The Iomanes appears in Ptolemy’s <i>Geography</i> as the Diamouna—that
is the Yamunâ or Jamnâ, the great river which, after passing Delhi,
Mathurâ, Agrâ, and other places, joins the Ganges at Allâhâbâd. It rises
from hot springs not far westward from the sources of the Ganges. Arrian,
who in his <i>Indika</i> calls it the Jobares, says that it flows through
the country of the Sourasenoi, who possess two great cities, Methora
(Mathurâ) and Kleisobara (Krishnapura?). Pliny (vi. 19) states that it
passes through the Palibothri to join the Ganges. At its junction with
the Jamnâ, and a third, but imaginary river, the Sarasvatî, the Ganges

who, according to Strabo (XI. i. 72), described it as a river that bred
crocodiles and dolphins, and that flowed into the Ganges. If the first
two letters in <i>Doanas</i> be transposed, we get almost letter for
letter the <i>Oidanes</i> of Artemidôros, and we get it again, though
not so closely, if we discard <i>r</i> from the Dyardanes of Curtius.
That these two writers had the same river in view is confirmed by their
mentioning the very same animals as bred in its waters.</p>

and of these he adopted that which fathered the name on King Erythrus. He
then tells the story of this king (who was a Persian) as he had learned
it from a Persian called Boxos who had settled in Athens. Strabo (xvi.
20) gives a brief summary of this passage, and Pliny (<i>N. H.</i> vi.
28) a still briefer. Nearchos, as we learn from Arrian’s <i>Indika</i>
(c. 37), in the course of his memorable voyage put into an island called
Oärakta (now Kishm), where the natives showed him the tomb of the first
king of the island. They said that his name was Erythrês, and that the
sea in those parts was called after him the <i>Erythraean</i>. Opinions
still differ as to the origin of the name. According to some it was
given from the red and purple colouring of the rocks which in some parts
border the sea, according to others from the red colour sometimes given
to the waters by the sea-weed called Sûph. Fresnel, however, rejecting
such views, interprets the name as meaning the sea of the Homêritai,
<i>i.e.</i> <i>Himyar</i> or <i>Hhomayr</i>, or <i>red men</i>, whose
name and the Arabic word <i>ahhmar</i> (red) have the same root. The
people here indicated occupied Yemen, and were called <i>red men</i> in
contrast to the <i>black men</i> of the opposite coast. Others again
attribute the name to <i>Edom</i> (Idumea), which bordered the Gulf
of Akaba, the eastern arm of the Red Sea, at its northern extremity.
<i>Edom</i> signifies <i>red</i>. Further references to this subject will
be found in Mela (III. viii. 1), Solinus (c. 36), Dio Cassius (lxviii.
28), and Stephanos Byz. <i>s.v.</i> Ἐρυθρά.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_213" href="#FNanchor_213" class="label">[213]</a> As the dress of the natives was made in ancient times as
at present, chiefly from cotton, this perhaps may be the substance meant
here by flax. The valuable properties of the wool-like product of the
cotton plant (<i>Gossypium herbaceum</i>, the <i>Karpâsa</i> of Sanskrit)
were early known, as in one of the hymns of the Rig-veda mention is made
of female weavers intertwining the extended thread. “The dress worn by
the Indians (says Arrian, citing Nearchos) is made of cotton, a material
produced from trees. They wear an under-garment of cotton which reaches
below the knee half-way down to the ankles, and also an upper garment
which they throw partly over their shoulders, and partly twist in folds
round their head” (<i>Indika</i>, c. 16). This costume is mentioned in
old Sanskrit literature, and is carefully represented in the frescoes
on the caves of Ajanta. We learn from the <i>Periplûs of the Erythraean
Sea</i> that muslin (othonion) was imported into the marts of India from
China, and exported thence along with Indian muslin and coarser cotton
fabrics to Egypt.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_214" href="#FNanchor_214" class="label">[214]</a> Strabo (XV. i. 67) states on the authority of Nearchos
that the Indians wrote letters upon cloth, which was well pressed to
make it smooth, but adds that other writers affirmed that the Indians
had no knowledge of writing. They were, however, acquainted with writing
for some centuries before Alexander’s time, but whence they got their
alphabet is a question not yet quite settled, though the weight of
opinion inclines to assign it a Himyaritic origin. We learn from Pliny
(xiii. 21) that paper made from the papyrus plant did not come into
common use out of Egypt till the time of Alexander the Great. He then
goes on to say that for writing on, the leaves of palm-trees were first
used, and then the barks (<i>libri</i>) of certain trees. Some of the
Egyptian papyrus-rolls are as old as the sixth dynasty.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_215" href="#FNanchor_215" class="label">[215]</a> Nearchos, as we learn from Arrian’s <i>Indika</i>, c. 15,
was taken with surprise when he heard in India parrots talking like human
beings. Pliny says (x. 58) that India produces this bird, which is called
the <i>Septagen</i>, and that it salutes its masters, and pronounces the
words it hears. If it fails to do so it is beaten on the head, which
is as hard as its bill, with an iron rod, until it repeats the words
properly. Ovid (<i>Amores</i>, ii. 6) calls the parrot the imitative bird
from the Indians of the East. Another Indian bird, the Maina, which in
size and appearance somewhat resembles the thrush, can be taught to speak
with great distinctness. It is probably the bird which Aelian (<i>Hist.
Anim.</i> xvi. 3) describes under the name of the <i>Kerkiôn</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_216" href="#FNanchor_216" class="label">[216]</a> Here Curtius makes a mistake, for not only is the
rhinoceros bred in India, but the Indian species is the largest known,
and its flesh was, by the Brahmans, allowed to be eaten, though most
other kinds of animal food were interdicted. Ktêsias describes it, but
very incorrectly, under the name of the one-horned ass. It is described
also in Aelian’s <i>History of Animals</i> (xvi. 20) in a passage
supposed to have been copied from the lost <i>Indika</i> of Megasthenes.
It is there called the Kartazôn. The fables about the unicorn had their
source most probably in the fanciful account Ktêsias has given of the
Indian wild ass. Aristotle, referring to it, says briefly: “We have
never seen a solid-hoofed animal with two horns, and there are only a
few of them that have one horn, as the Indian ass and the oryx.” Kosmas
Indikopleustes, who, as his surname shows, had visited India, gives in
the eleventh book of his <i>Christian Topography</i> a description of the
rhinoceros, illustrated with a picture of the animal which represents
it as somewhat like a horse, with its nose surmounted by a pair of
horns slightly curved. We know that the picture is meant to be that of
the rhinoceros from the name being attached. Kosmas says that he had
only seen the animal from a distance. He has also given a description
and picture of the unicorn, an animal which he had never seen, but had
delineated from four brazen statues of it which adorned a palace in
Aethiopia. A single straight horn of great length is represented as
springing up from the top of its head.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_217" href="#FNanchor_217" class="label">[217]</a> Pliny (<i>Nat. Hist</i>. viii. 11) notes, like Curtius
here, that India produced the largest elephants. He had, however, stated
previously (vi. 22) that, according to Onesikritos, the elephants of
Taprobane (Ceylon) were larger and more warlike than those of India. Many
references to the Indian elephants occur in the classics. Arrian, in the
thirteenth and fourteenth chapters of his <i>Indika</i>, describes the
mode in which they were hunted, and other particulars regarding them.
Polybios (v. 84) says that the African elephants could neither endure the
smell nor the trumpeting of their Indian congeners.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_218" href="#FNanchor_218" class="label">[218]</a> Herodotos (iii. 106) says that gold was produced in great
abundance in India, some of it washed down by the streams, and some
dug out of the earth, but the greater part of it being the ant-gold
surreptitiously procured. The heavy tribute levied by Darius on the
Indian provinces (chiefly west of the Indus) was paid in gold-dust. We
learn, notwithstanding, from Arrian that the companions of Alexander
found that the Indian tribes they met with, which were numerous, were
destitute of gold. The ant-gold produced in Dardistan seems therefore to
have found its way rather to the provinces west of the Indus than to the
Panjâb. Strabo (XV. i. 57), quoting Megasthenes, says that the rivers in
India bring down gold-dust, a part of which is paid as a tax to the king.
By the king is here meant Chandragupta (Sandrokottos), at whose court
Megasthenes for some years resided. As the river Sôn, which in his time
entered the Ganges at Palibothra (now Patna), was called poetically the
<i>Hiranyavâha</i>—<i>i.e.</i> “bearing gold,”—we may assume that
gold was found in the sands of that river. The grandson of Chandragupta,
Aśôka, as is stated in the <i>Mahavansâ</i>, sent missionaries to preach
Buddhism into the <i>gold district</i> of Suvarnabhûmi, a region which
Turnour identified with Burma, but which Lassen took to be a maritime
district situated somewhere in the west (<i>v.</i> his <i>Ind. Alt.</i>
ii. pp. 236, 237; also i. 237, 238). Strabo (XV. i. 30) says that in the
country of Sopeithês there were valuable mines both of gold and silver
among the mountains.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_219" href="#FNanchor_219" class="label">[219]</a> Pliny, in the latter part of his 37th book, treats of the
various kinds of precious stones found in India, and of the uses to which
they are there applied. In some of the other books incidental notices
of them are also to be met with, while his 9th book is full of details
about the pearl. From Strabo (II. iii. 4) we learn that an adventurer,
Eudoxos of Kyzikos, who had been sent by Ptolemy Physkôn, king of Egypt,
to India, returned thence, bringing back with him precious stones, some
of which the Indians collect from among the pebbles of the river, and
others of which they dig out of the earth. In his 15th book he states
that India produces precious stones, as crystals, carbuncles of all
kinds, and pearls. In Ptolemy’s <i>Geography of India</i>, and in the
<i>Periplûs of the Erythraean Sea</i> mention is made of the diamond,
beryl, onyx, carnelian, hyacinth, and sapphire as precious stones of
India. They mention also various pearl fisheries existing in and near
India. Arrian states in his <i>Indika</i> (c. 8) that the pearl in India
is worth thrice its weight in refined gold, and that it was called in
the Indian tongue <i>Margarita</i>. This, which is also its classical
name, may represent either the Sanskrit <i>manjari</i>, or the Persian
<i>marwarîd</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_220" href="#FNanchor_220" class="label">[220]</a> Arrian, on the authority of Nearchos, states in his
<i>Indika</i> (c. 16) that the Indians wear shoes of white leather
elaborately trimmed, and having thick soles (or heels) to make them look
taller.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_221" href="#FNanchor_221" class="label">[221]</a> Strabo notes from Kleitarchos similar statements regarding
the treatment of their hair by the Indians (XV. i. 71), and Arrian has
noted the Indian practice (which is still in vogue) of dying the beard of
a variety of colours.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_222" href="#FNanchor_222" class="label">[222]</a> “In the processions at Indian festivals (says Strabo,
XV. i. 69) are to be seen wild beasts, as buffaloes, panthers, tame
lions, and a multitude of birds of variegated plumage and of fine song.”
Aelian, in a passage copied most probably from Megasthenes, says that the
favourite bird of the king of the Indians (Chandragupta no doubt) was the
hoopoe. He carried it on his wrist, and amused himself with it, and never
tired gazing with admiration on its exquisite beauty, and the splendour
of its plumage. The luxurious mode of life in which the Indian king
(Chandragupta) indulged is described by Strabo (XV. i. 55) much in the
same terms as by Curtius here. The native writings called <i>sutras</i>
describe in like manner how the kings at festivals march out on elephants
to the sound of all kinds of instruments, amid the scent of perfumes and
clouds of frankincense.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_223" href="#FNanchor_223" class="label">[223]</a> Strabo adds the significant statement that the king at
night is obliged from time to time to change his couch from dread of
treachery. The frequency of changes in the succession shows that such
a precaution was not unnecessary. If a woman put to death a king when
he was drunk, she was rewarded by becoming the wife of his successor.
From Athênaios we learn that among the Indians the king might not get
drunk. The assertion made by Curtius that the Indians all use much wine
is contrary to the testimony of Megasthenes, who said that they use
it only on sacrificial occasions. Wine was no doubt imported into the
marts of the Malabar coast, but the quantity must have been limited, and
could only have been purchased by the rich. The Brahmans of the Ganges,
from whom Megasthenes obtained much information, punished indulgence
in intoxicating drinks with great severity. The Aryans of the Panjâb
were less abstemious, and this led to dissensions, and a final rupture
between them and their brethren of Iran. The wine used at sacrifices was
the fermented juice of the plant called <i>soma</i>. When required for
drinking it was mixed with milk.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_224" href="#FNanchor_224" class="label">[224]</a> The diversity of views which prevailed in India regarding
suicide was noticed by Megasthenes. The book of the law, in case of
incapacity, regards it as meritorious, but the Buddhists altogether
condemned it. Pliny (vi. 19) says that the Indian sages <i>always</i>
ended their life by a voluntary death on the funeral pile.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_225" href="#FNanchor_225" class="label">[225]</a> This is a very vague and meagre account of the opinions

of Alexander</i>, 64, 65). References are made to it by Mela, Suidas,

<p><a id="Footnote_231" href="#FNanchor_231" class="label">[231]</a> Justin (xii. 7) speaks of mountains which he
calls <i>Daedali</i>, and these Cunningham (p. 52) takes to be
Mount <i>Dantalok</i>, which is about three miles distant from
<i>Palo-dheri</i> (or <i>Pelley</i>, as General Court calls it), a place
forty miles distant from Pashkalavati (Hasht-nagar). In the spoken
dialect, he adds, <i>Dantalok</i> becomes <i>Dattalok</i>, which the
Greek <i>Daidalos</i> may fairly be taken to represent. I think, however,
Alexander had not penetrated so far eastward as this identification
implies. It has been taken by Müller to be Arrian’s <i>Andaka</i> or
<i>Andêla</i>, which he would therefore alter to <i>Daidala</i>. An
Indian city called <i>Daidala</i> is mentioned by Stephanos Byz., and in
Ptolemy’s <i>Geography</i> another city of the same name is mentioned as
belonging to the Kaspeiraioi (or Kashmirians), who in Ptolemy’s days had
extended their rule as far eastward as the regions of the Jamna. Abbot in
his <i>Gradus ad Aornon</i> seems to identify Daedala with Doodial, and
Acadira, which is mentioned immediately after, with Kaldura.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_232" href="#FNanchor_232" class="label">[232]</a> Arrian calls this river the <i>Euaspla</i>. It is most

of the elements of the name of the people in its neighbourhood, the

without the help of the gods since they were able to move forward engines

in the battle. Curtius here follows Chares, as the following passage
quoted from this writer by Aulus Gellius (<i>Noct. Attic.</i> v. 2) will
show: “The horse of King Alexander was both by his head and by his name
<i>Bucephalas</i> (<i>i.e.</i> ox-head). Cares has stated that he was
bought for thirteen talents, and presented to King Philip.... Regarding
this horse it seems worth recording that when caparisoned and armed for
battle he would not suffer himself to be mounted by any one but the king.
It is also told of this horse that in the Indian war when Alexander,
mounted upon him, and performing noble deeds of bravery, had with too
little heed for his own safety entangled himself amid a battalion of
the enemy, where he was on all sides assailed with darts, his horse was
stabbed with deep wounds in the neck and sides. Ready to expire, and
drained of nearly all his blood, he nevertheless bore back the king from
the midst of his foes at a most rapid pace; and when he had conveyed
him beyond reach of spears, he straightway dropped down, and having no
further fear for his master’s safety, he breathed his last as if with
the consolation of human sensibility. Then King Alexander having gained
the victory in this war, built a town on this spot, and in honour of his
horse called it Bucephalon.”</p>

in which are arranged all the telling sentences that some of the most
famous Roman rhetoricians could compose to suit the situation. The
remarkable parallels found in this collection to the present speech of
Curtius illustrates in a very striking way the artificial nature of
these harangues, and show what a vast amount of labour this spirited and
polished specimen probably took to produce. The corresponding speech in
Arrian, v. 27, though less pointed than that in Curtius, is more natural

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_281" href="#FNanchor_281" class="label">[281]</a> “It is recorded,” said Colonel Chesney in his Simla
lecture on Alexander, “that he sent to Greece for 20,000 fresh suits of
armour. A suit of armour and arms probably weighed three-fourths of a
maund (60 lbs.), and we may assume that with the arms a good many other
articles were indented for at the same time. Altogether we may take it
that the requisition was for not less than from 20,000 to 30,000 mule
loads—30,000 laden mules to be despatched from Macedonia to the Satlej!
A large order. And this suggests another consideration. Alexander’s army
on the Satlej was 50,000 strong; how about his lines of communication?
During the late Afghan war over 50,000 men crossed the frontier, yet I
believe the general had never at any time more than 10,000 men in hand
at the front; the rest were swallowed up in holding obligatory posts and
keeping up the line of communication. Now if 40,000 men are needed for
this purpose to keep 10,000 effective in the front, when the distance
to be covered was only 200 miles, what would be the force required to
secure the line of communication between Macedonia and the army halted on
the banks of the Satlej? The answer is to be found in the system of war
pursued by Alexander’s Greek generals, and garrisons were left at certain
points on the road; and where complete submission was made, the enemy
was left in possession of his country and converted into an ally. But
when the resistance was obstinate Alexander left no enemies behind.” As
Alexander led into India 120,000 men, Colonel Chesney’s estimate that he
had only 50,000 at the Hyphasis (which he calls the Satlej) must surely
be far below the mark.</p>

months, but we may strike off a month from this estimate. The voyage
began near the end of October 326 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The distance from the

the feet of murky Styx ... where eternal night, wrapped in her pall of
gloom, sits brooding in unending silence.” The passage was probably,
however, suggested by the lines of the sixth book of the <i>Aeneid</i>,
794-796: “He (Augustus Caesar) will stretch his sway beyond Garamantian
and Indian. See, the land is lying outside the stars, outside the sun’s

consequence to keep the field together. Both these historians are silent
as to the operations conducted by Alexander during his march from the
junction of the Hydaspês and the Akesinês to the capital of the Malloi
situated above the old junction of the united stream of these two rivers
with the Hydraôtês.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_291" href="#FNanchor_291" class="label">[291]</a> Thirlwall, with good reason, regards this incident as a
mere embellishment of the story. “It is certain,” he says, “that even
if Alexander believed in such things less than he appears to have done,
he was too prudent to disclose his incredulity, and so throw away an
instrument which a Greek general might so often find useful” (<i>Hist.
of Greece</i>, vii. c. 54). The story is found in Diodôros also. If
a fiction, it may have been suggested by the fact that Alexander on
approaching Babylon, where he died, was warned by Chaldaean soothsayers
not to enter that city. If true, Alexander had doubtless in his mind the
words of Hector (<i>Iliad</i>, xii. 237-243), where he expresses his
contempt for omens drawn from the flight of birds. Hannibal had a similar
contempt, as appears from Cicero, <i>de Div.</i> ii.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_292" href="#FNanchor_292" class="label">[292]</a> Curtius, like Plutarch, represents Alexander to have been
wounded after he had scaled the <i>city</i> wall, and thence leaped down
into the <i>city</i>. But this is a mistake. It was the wall of the

wounded, as we learn both from Arrian and Diodôros.</p>

the many coloured flags of the vessels, as we may infer from the words of
Pliny (xix. 1): “The first attempt at dyeing canvas with the costliest
hues for dyeing wearing apparel was made in the fleets of Alexander the
Great when he was navigating the river Indus, for then his generals
and prefects had distinguished by differences of colour the ensigns of
their vessels, and the natives along the shore were lost in amazement at
the variety of their colours. It was with a purple sail Cleopatra came
with Antony to Actium, and fled therefrom. This was the colour of the

<p><a id="Footnote_338" href="#FNanchor_338" class="label">[338]</a> Alexander’s campaign, in which he conquered the country
extending from the Hindu Kush to the Indus, took place in the year 327
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> In the year following he marched eastward through the
Panjâb as far as the Hyphasis, conquering on his way Pôros and the
Kathaians, and from the Hyphasis he retraced his way to the Hydaspês.
He then sailed down that river, and then down the Akesinês into which
it falls, until about the end of the year he reached the Indus. It
will be seen from Arrian, v. 19, that the battle with Pôros was fought
in the archonship of Hêgemôn at Athens, whose year of office, it is
otherwise known, extended from the 28th of June 327 to the 17th of July
326 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Hêgemôn was succeeded by Chremês, so that Diodôros
antedates his archonship. He was archon after the defeat of Pôros and
not before. With regard to the two consuls named, it does not appear
that they ever held the consulship simultaneously. Publius Cornelius
(Scipio Barbatus) was consul in 328 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> along with C. Plautius
Decianus. In the following year <i>Spurius</i> Postumius Albinus was
master of the horse to the Dictator Claudius Marcellus, but I can find
nowhere in the lists the name of <i>Aulus</i> Postumius as holding any
office about that time. In Smith’s <i>Classical Dictionary</i> the year
327 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> appears as the <i>annus mirabilis</i> of Alexander’s
life, for early in the spring he completes the conquest of Sogdiana and
marries Roxana. Thereafter he returns to Baktra, then marches to invade
India, and crossing the Hydaspês defeats Pôros. He then marches to the
Hyphasis, and thence returns to the Hydaspês. In the autumn he sails down
the Hydaspês to the Indus! See vol. iii. p. 1346 and vol. i. <i>s.v.</i>
Alexander III. The events of two years are thus compressed into the space
of a single year. Clinton’s chronology, which is very confused for the
period from 327 to 323, seems to have been followed.</p>

generally aiming at the eye. A bull, which was thus wounded at Dazagon,
tore up the ground with extreme fury, and died in half an hour, foaming
at the mouth. The habit of the reptile is truly singular, for it seems to
proceed neither from resentment nor from fear, nor yet from the impulse
of appetite; but seems, ‘more than any other known fact in natural
history, to partake of that frightful and mysterious principle of evil,
which tempts our species so often to tyrannize for mere wantonness of

to suppose that he wrote so carelessly that he did not mean what his
words seem to imply.</p>

or the Calif of <i>The Thousand and One Nights</i> who was to strangle
his wife when she came to the end of her stories. But it is Plutarch who

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
